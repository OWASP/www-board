## Note from the Executive Director

The Compliance Committee recommends that the minutes for the special meeting be adjusted to reflect the lack of proxy voting in our bylaws. This means that Martin Knobloch's attendance should not be counted toward quorum, and his votes should be struck from the record. 

I have made the attendance reflect this, and removed his vote from the record. His votes were "Yes" on all votes. However, Martin had instructed in writing for Owen to vote on his behalf, but to abstain on the Vacancy clarity motion, but now they are now all removed and the vote numbers changed to reflect the recommendation. The Board can approve to make this so.

## CHANGES TO THE AGENDA


## OUT-OF-CYCLE MOTIONS 

 As reported by the Executive Director

### E-vote (1) on good standing if the membership systems fail for any reason

Motion: "It is resolved that any member whose membership lapsed due to issues with the membership management system, but who otherwise fulfils the requirements to stand for the Board, should be granted exemption from the "paid" component of the "in good standing" clause for eligibility so long as they can show evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership.

Evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership would involve: an email trail between the member and the Foundation's staff showing an honest attempt to pay for one's membership through acceptable means; evidence of a failed transaction to the OWASP account; or evidence of a credit to a member's membership belatedly applied by the Foundation. Should there be any doubt as the validity of the claim a majority vote of the Board will decide the outcome on a case-by-case basis."

### Motion: Clarify e-Vote Motion (5) to include Candidates regarding conflicts of interest

Motion: "It is resolved that the passed motion on conflicts of interest will contain the following clarifications. The replacement section will now read:

"At the time of their election, to qualify to stand, candidates must hold an Individual membership, Lifetime membership, or hold a valid Honorary Membership. This membership must have been in place for a 12 month period prior to the date of the election."

(bold italics contains the amended text)
SECTION 3.14 Good standing grace period

Directors and Candidates for the Board who have lapses in good standing have a grace period of 7 days to renew their membership.

### Motion: Motion to address vacancy clarity

"It is resolved to amend the Vacancy provisions in the OWASP bylaws to address the Compliance Committee report recommendation to "clarify that Directors that exit their term prematurely have served a two-year term for the purposes of term limits, and Directors that serve a partial term to fill a vacancy have not served a two-year term for the purposes of term limits." This motion will take effect November 1, 2020. 

This motion replaces section 2.05 and 3.10 with the following text. The italic text is new.

SECTION 2.05 Vacancies

A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term.

If a Director creates a Vacancy, such as being removed or resigned, the entire term is considered served for that Member for the purposes of term limits."

SECTION 3.10 Vacancies

Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors unless otherwise provided by law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes then the ultimate determination shall be made by the then­ sitting Chairman of the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the Directors.

Appointed Directors filling a vacancy shall not have this partial term counted against term limits."

Subsidiary Motion: It is resolved to amend the vacancy appointment bylaws in section 3.10 to prevent multiple appointments to get around term limits, by adding to the end of the main amendment the following text:

Members can only be appointed to fill a vacancy once every ten years to prevent bypassing term limits." to section 3.10."

Foundation funds should not be used to pay for membership. Foundation paid memberships of any class, from any funding source including conferences, chapters, projects, donations, etc, shall not constitute paid membership nor possess voting rights."
