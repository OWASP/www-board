### COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

#### Grant and Fundraising Strategy

OWASP is in the very nascent stage of fundraising. The last time we attempted to obtain a grant, an offer was made to buy us, which shows how unprepared we are for serious fundraising efforts.

A short presentation by Teresa Huff, Nonprofit Strategist and Grant Writing Mentor, discussing the development and implementation of a self-sustaining and mature fundraising and grant writing program at OWASP.

#### Maribor Chapter Discussion

The Maribor Chapter is run by some of OWASP's most respected and longest active members. To discuss the background and a resolution to this situation, Milan Gabor and Gregor Spagnolo have agreed to meet with the Board.

During COVID, the Maribor chapter has failed to achieve meeting requirements. During the BAU review to start the process of deactivation, it was discovered that a new entity has been registered in Slovenia, an EU nation. The entity is called "OWASP Association":

https://owasp.si/

"A non-profit organization founded with the aim of realizing common interests in the field of information security and related fields. The association also acts as a local group of the global organization OWASP, which works to improve software security. We are active in Slovenia and the wider region." (Google Translate)

The signing authority for creating new entities resides with the Board, and not chapter leaders. Under the Code of Conduct, participants, members and leaders agree to abide by all policies. The Chapter policy explicitly prohibits signing contracts, as does the signing authority policy. Sanctions under the Code of Conduct:

"Depending on the severity of the breach, the member or participant can accept the 30-day suspension, or in serious cases, the member or participant will be referred to the Compliance Committee for a decision regarding their ongoing participation or membership by the OWASP Board at the next available Board meeting."

As this is a first time breach, and is likely done in good faith, we will need a decision on how to proceed from the Board after the discussion.

#### Discussion on Developer Conferences

Outreach Committee to present Developer Conference proposal.

#### Discussion on Project Summit

Harold Blankenship to present an update on the AppSec San Francisco Project Summit.

#### Executive Session about potential Partnership

There will be an adjournment into an executive session to discuss a potential partnership with another non-profit. This may lead to a vote, so quorum should be maintained.


### ADJOURNMENT

#### Adjournment motion

The next general Board meeting is on August 23, at 12 pm US Eastern Time.

- [August 2022](https://owasp.org/www-board/meetings/202208.html)

Sponsor: Vandana Verma
Second: Avi Douglen
