- 01-01-2024 - Any Director-elect who is not a paid member by this date has not qualified to be a Director under our bylaws, and has 7 days grace to obtain paid membership
- 08-01-2023 - Any Director-elect who still has not obtained paid membership after the grace period, has not qualified to be a Director. The next most voted candidate will take their place

Directors are solely responsible for maintaining good standing as a paid member throughout their term, or a vote of confidence will be held by the Board. This has happened several times in the past. We strongly urge Director-elects to take out sufficient membership to cover their entire term to avoid issues with standing. Adding a two year membership to your current membership or changing to a Lifetime membership is the ideal way to avoid this issue entirely.
