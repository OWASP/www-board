The OWASP Foundation was established in 2001 as an open community and software security resource. Since then, OWASP has 
grown to be globally recognized as a credible source for application security standards (see industry citations). Individuals 
typically find OWASP when searching the internet for information about software security - and they are happy to find a 
reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and passionate community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend 
OWASP's vendor agnostic local chapter meetings, participate in regional and global conferences, and contribute to the many 
OWASP projects. And anyone can start a new project, form a new chapter, or lend their expertise to help an OWASP Global Committee.

The OWASP Foundation Board of Directors currently consists of seven elected volunteers. These unpaid volunteers dedicate 
themselves to the organizational mission and playing a pivotal role in the software security community. OWASP conducts democratic 
elections of its Board Members to enable bottom-up advancement of its mission.

#### Who Can Vote?

As of the adoption of the new OWASP Bylaws on July 8, 2024, OWASP Individual Members who are in good standing as of the published Membership Deadline (usually on or around September 30) of the election year are eligible to vote in the OWASP Global Board Elections.

OWASP Individual members are defined in the bylaws as "The Individual Member class has the following subclasses: Standard, Regional, Student, Lifetime, and Distinguished Lifetime. Only the Board shall grant Distinguished Lifetime Membership." Complimentary memberships are not considered Individual Memberships and therefore do not have voting rights.

If you are not an Individual member yet, we encourage you to [join](https://members.owasp.org) by the Membership deadline, which is usually on or around September 30.

#### How to Vote?

Eligible voting members will receive an email to their registered email address from owasp@simplyvoting.com with subject
"BALLOT FOR OWASP [YEAR] Board Election"

This email will include a specific link for you to cast your vote.  Please do ***NOT*** share this link with anyone.  
It is a specific link ***JUST FOR YOU***!

Additionally, eligible voting members will also receive an email from the OWASP Foundation notifying them that their ballot has 
been sent. In the instance that they did not receive a ballot they are asked to [contact us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72).
