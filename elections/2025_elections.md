**Call For Candidates**

Paid Individual Members who have been in good standing for more than 12 months can stand for the Board. To apply, please search your email for OWASP 2025 Global Board Election Kickoff, which includes all details.


----

**Directors are solely responsible for maintaining good standing as a paid member throughout their term, or a vote of confidence will be held by the Board. This has happened several times in the past. We strongly urge Director-elects to take out sufficient membership to cover their entire term to avoid issues with standing. Adding a two year membership to your current membership or changing to a Lifetime membership is the ideal way to avoid this issue entirely.**
