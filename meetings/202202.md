### e-Votes and Special Meeting Motions to read into minutes

#### Motion to join Nonprofit Cyber as a founding member

**Rationale**  Nonprofit Cyber is a first-of-its-kind coalition of global nonprofit organizations to enhance joint action to improve cybersecurity. All coalition members are nonprofits that were formed to serve the public interest by developing, sharing, deploying, and increasing the awareness of cybersecurity best practices, tools, standards, and services. 
As it grows, Nonprofit Cyber may work to:

- Achieve visibility and understanding of the efforts nonprofits are making in cybersecurity;
- Facilitate shared understanding, alignment and deconfliction of activities;
- Encourage the leadership, sharing, and celebration of volunteers;
- Advertise the association and collaboration of nonprofits;
- Encourage and enable specific reference among members to each other’s products where applicable;
- Provide a forum for sharing roadmaps of product development and release;
- Enable and encourage synchronization of product releases where appropriate;
- Create opportunities for joint or coordinated projects and products among members;
- Provide a forum for alignment of threat and/or attack models that drive security practice selection;
- Provide a forum for coordination of joint (by supporting members) public statements and joint communications to authorities on issues of mutual interest, and on the importance of shared and voluntary industry best practices;
- Prepare and deliver joint presentations to stakeholders; and
- Submit joint proposals for work and funding.

Nonprofit Cyber has no authority to commit or direct members, but is a “collaboration-of-equals”: a good-faith effort to better serve the entire community through expert agreement and collaboration. It does not assert any functional or operational control over any party, force any action by any party, or prevent an organization from holding a unique position on any particular issue or topic.
Motion: "This motion is to join the new to be founded "nonprofit cyber" organization by signing the member agreement as attached and install Martin Knobloch as liaison from OWASP toward the 'Nonprofit Cyber'"

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve budget and travel for Defcon

**Background** Defcon is occurring in August 2022, and the Outreach Committee wish to run a table and sell / giveaway merch. A request for travel for staff or Board to travel to handle cash. Issues and boundaries around Defcon as an outreach committee target, a sponsor, and other issues should be discussed.

- [Draft budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hf9OhyTzqoJbn2Ahuw5Jngj76G27aAn0w46-Wucslwc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the budget and travel for Defcon is approved."

**Sponsor:** Grant Ongers
**Second:** Vandana Verma

### COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

#### Discussion on Trademark Strategy

The current strategy is expensive, not really meeting its goals of bringing in income, and difficult and expensive to enforce. Corporate Members have shown little interest in taking up trademark licenses, despite being included in most tiers. We need a new strategy, one that is simpler, one that is attractive to the corporate community, and one that earns income in its own right, rather than being a burden.

Andrew van der Stock will take the Board through the current and proposed strategy, but as fees are set by the Board, any changes would require a vote at some point in the future.

### ADJOURNMENT

#### Adjournment motion

The next general Board meeting is on March 22 2022, at 12 pm US Eastern Time.

"It is moved, and seconded to adjourn. Those in favor, say "aye""
