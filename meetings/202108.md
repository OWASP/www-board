### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve Expenses Policy

**Background:** The revised Expenses policy is the penultimate part of finance reform started in the 2021 Operating Plan, with only the Travel Policy to come. There have been two sets of Town Halls to discuss with the community at large, and discussions with Project and Event leaders to garner stakeholder buyin. The new Expenses policy is fairly similar to both our previous Expenses policy in terms of permitted expenses, but operates in the same way as the COVID restrictions temporary expenses process. The goal is for expenses to become more petty cash level reimbursements for project, chapter, and budgeted event expenses, with a level of oversight and responsibility placed on the shoulders of those submitting the claims. This should reduce the friction betwen the community and the Foundation on "acceptable" expenses, whilst protecting the Foundation from many unreasonable expense claims.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the revised Expenses Policy is approved, effective August 24, 2021."
