#### Motion to approve the 2021 Budget

"Background: Each year, the Foundation sets a budget to match its operating plan and priorities. This year is slightly different, with a survival mode budget. This budget has the lowest expectation of income and expenses for many years, with the expectation that as the vaccination rollout proceeds, life can start to get back to normal, and we might be able to exceed this budget. If that doesn't happen, this budget has a very slim profit, and with careful stewardship of our funds throughout the year, there's every likelihood that we will not make a loss. The major risk is events: the previous events director did not prepare a formal budget, and many of the events had to change. Therefore, we envisage there might be some ad hoc requests for event budgets to allow events to go ahead where the Foundation thinks they will be profitable. The only planned events are LASCON and AppSec Australia, both regional AppSec Days events. Lastly, this budget assumes that there will be finance reform, and therefore makes allowances for limited awards & scholarships, grants, and expenses.
<br>
Update: The draft Budget was tabled in the February board meeting after concerns and discussions, and corrections were made in the intervening period with meetings between Kelly Santalucia, Tom Pappas, Grant Ongers, and Andrew van der Stock. This revised budget is conservative in nearly all estimates, with many opportunities to exceed but also risks where income may fall flat. It will be vital that expenses are carefully managed throughout the year. All Board members voted, and the majority selected this time slot by preference, with only one Board member voting "if need be". The vote will need to be a majority vote (4/7 votes) to pass."

- [Draft 2021 Budget](/www-board/attachments/202103-draft-budget-summary.xlsx)"

#### Motion to conduct an independent board evluation for the OWASP Foundation

Through Board Source, the current Board training provider, we have a single annual complimentary board evulation service at no additional cost.

#### Motion to pass Grants Policy

**Background** Grants help fulfill our mission to improve the security of software globally. Any OWASP Member, Chapter, Project, Committee, or Event may create grants for mission-related activities or deliverables, including sabbaticals. This policy creates financially responsible funding mechanisms and a consistent and transparent process to approve, fund, and deliver grant outcomes.

**Motion** "Resolved, the OWASP Board passes the new Grants policy, and directs the OWASP Foundation to consult with the community and create procedures for its safe and effective operation no later than April 30, 2021."

#### Motion to pass Awards & Scholarship Policy

**Background** This policy encourages our community to establish awards or prizes for OWASP competitions and scholarships and travel assistance for OWASP events. Awards recognize high impact members, chapters, initiatives, projects, or as prizes for OWASP competitions. Scholarships fulfill our mission to underserved and disadvantaged communities and individuals, improving equity and access for those who need assistance. This policy creates financially responsible funding mechanisms, published eligibility and selection criteria, and a consistent and transparent process to award prizes or recipients.

**Motion** "Resolved, the OWASP Board passes the new Awards and Scholarships policy, and directs the OWASP Foundation to consult with the community and create procedures for its safe and effective operation no later than April 30, 2021."
