### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to approve the 2021 Budget

**Background**: Each year, the Foundation sets a budget to match its operating plan and priorities. This year is slightly different, with a survival mode budget. This budget has the lowest expectation of income and expenses for many years, with the expectation that as the vaccination rollout proceeds, life can start to get back to normal. We might be able to exceed this budget. If that doesn't happen, this budget has a very slim profit. With careful stewardship of our funds throughout the year, there's every likelihood that we will not make a loss. The significant risk is events: the previous events director did not prepare a formal budget. Many of the events had to change. Therefore, we envisage some ad hoc requests for event budgets to allow events to go ahead where the Foundation thinks they will be profitable. The only planned events are LASCON and AppSec Australia, both regional AppSec Days events. Lastly, this budget assumes that there will be finance reform, making allowances for limited awards & scholarships, grants, and expenses.

**Update**: The draft Budget was tabled in the February board meeting after concerns and discussions, and Tom Pappas and the Foundation made corrections in the intervening period with meetings between Kelly Santalucia, Tom Pappas, Grant Ongers, and Andrew van der Stock. This revised budget is conservative in nearly all estimates, with many opportunities to exceed and risks where income may fall flat. It will be vital that expenses are carefully managed throughout the year. All Board members voted. The majority selected this time slot by preference, with only one Board member voting "if need be". The Vote will need to be a majority vote (4/7 votes) to pass.

- [Draft 2021 Budget](/www-board/attachments/202103-draft-budget-summary.xlsx)

**Motion**: "Resolved, the 2021 OWASP Foundation budget is formally approved. Grant Ongers motions, Vandana Verma seconds"

- Martin Knobloch - Yes
- Grant Ongers - Yes
- Joubin Jabbari - Yes
- Owen Pendlebury - Yes
- Vandana Verma - Yes

### NEW BUSINESS

### Consent Package

**Background** The following pull request contains routine/standard/non-controversial changes are motioned for a vote without discussion. The changes address gender-neutral phrasing, minor typos/grammar corrections, and related minor issues identified by our lawyers during the bylaw review.

- [March Consent Pull Request](https://github.com/OWASP/www-policy/pull/35/commits/89054afc2677aa31ed4bc063f245604d781197cf)

- Sponsor: Sherif Mansour
- Second: TBA

**Motion** "Resolved, the Board consent votes to minor changes to the bylaws to address grammar, routine, and non-controversial changes to the OWASP Foundation bylaws."

#### Motion to conduct an independent board evluation for the OWASP Foundation

**Background:** The OWASP Foundation has not had a recent independent board evaluation for some time. Periodic Board evaluations are standard practice for boards. Through Board Source, the current Board training provider, we have a single annual complimentary board evaluation service at no additional cost.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the board directs the OWASP Foundation to schedule and conduct a board evaluation for the OWASP Foundation with our existing Board training provider (Board Source)."

- Sponsor: Sherif Mansour
- Second: Grant Ongers

#### Developer Outreach Motion (Vandana)

**Background:** OWASP has a huge list of projects but developers have very little knowledge about them. With the developer engagement program, we will do the following things to bring them closer to OWASP.

**Motion:**

### Staff Reports

#### Executive Director

**Membership drive**

The Two Year Membership drive has been a tremendous success. As of the time of writing, we have an 8.46% increase in memberships compared to February, with 223 full and regional two-year memberships sold during March, versus 60 in the same time frame in 2020. We have also had 120 one-year, and 10 Lifetime memberships during March so far, for a total of 353 memberships sold. This an all time membership high, and one of the largest organic sales months we've ever had.

Lisa is running an associated direct mail campaign targeting AppSec Cali attendees, whose membership is due to expire at the end of March. Of the 292 we identified in February, we believe just 10 have renewed. We will continue to run mail campaigns in the lead up to the end of their membership on top of our standard renewal notifications. If few renew, this will cause a dip in memberships in April, down from this month's all time high.

We are expected to run a regional membership drive in April to coincide with a regional Brain Break event to be held in India. Lastly, I'd like to run a Lifetime membership drive during September to coincide with our 20th Anniversary.

**20th Anniversary Kick Off**

We opened the 20th Anniversary celebrations with a call to papers and sponsorship for a 24-hour event on September 24th, 2021. The 20th Anniversary event will be a truly global event spanning the entire planet. We've had tremendous sponsor interest in the event, which we will continue to promote in the coming months. 

**Lapse in Vandana Verma's Membership**

We became aware of a lapse in Vandana Verma's membership during March after Vandana herself asked about her membership status. Vandana's membership lapsed on 2/4/2021, and to her credit, she immediately became a Lifetime OWASP member on 3/17/2021. All other Board members are either lifetime members, not up for re-election this year, or are ineligible to run again. Vandana's lapse in good standing was over a month. The bylaws and Director's agreement clearly state that Directors are responsible for maintaining their membership in good standing:

> "Directors are responsible for maintaining their membership in good standing for the duration of their term.
> A Director or Candidate for the Board shall have maintained continuous membership in good standing over the previous 12 months, notwithstanding any grace periods established in these bylaws.
> At the time of their election, to qualify to stand, candidates must hold an Individual membership, Lifetime membership, or hold a valid Honorary Membership. This membership must have been in place for a 12 month period prior to the date of the election."
- [Source](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws#section-302-number-tenure-and-qualifications)

After an initial and ongoing investigation, the issue (see Harold's report below) seems to be a corner case business logic flaw relating to canceling a recurring membership payment. Our payments system and code acted as it should - it did not renew Vandana's membership (and anyone else who did the same). However, once Vandana canceled the recurring payment, the business logic flow did not trigger the standard automatic renewal notices sent to non-recurring memberships. The end result is that Vandana did not receive any membership expiry warnings (and anyone else who did the same thing). Our bylaws do not require that the Foundation or our systems notify Directors of their expiry.

Our preliminary search for all affected members says that only Vandana was affected by this particular business logic flaw. We continue to investigate because the issue of election eligibility means that a Board motion to resolve this issue for anyone affected by the flaw will be needed.

The 2020 Board has set precedent on allowing ineligible members stand for election. That said, the bylaws were beefed up to make it clear that Directors are solely responsible for maintaining good standing. The Board should discuss the following options:

- Follow the 2020 precedent, and allow Vandana and any other person affected by the business logic flaw to stand in this year's elections, preferably with a safeguard. I suggest that they renew their membership within 7 days grace period after the Foundation's expiry notification. Such a motion should prevent new members who haven't previously had membership or membership within the past 12 months from standing in this year's election, but fix the issue and permit those that might have otherwise been eligible to stand. 
- Follow the bylaws and the Directors Agreement and not permit any ineligible person from standing in the 2021 election. 
- Review or revoke the good standing provision in the bylaws. I think this problematic for a membership non-profit, as it means non-members can be Board members. 

As this is regarding our bylaws and Director eligibility, which was only beefed up last year, I believe this to be a matter for the Board to decide. If a motion is to be crafted by the Board, it is introduced in the April or May Board meeting to hold a clean 2022 Board election. I would encourage Vandana to speak during this discussion, but during the vote, unlike last year's special meeting, for her to sit out the discussion and vote of a formal motion as she has a conflict of interest. On a personal note as an OWASP member, I would prefer that we stand by previous precedents rather than coming up with new outcomes every time, or that we manage to policy. 

**Finance Reform Progress**

I held three town halls in various timezones, with approximately 120 registrations and around 90 attendees across all three events. The discussion went well, and I think there is a general community consensus behind the finance reform agenda. The first two policies have been through community review and are to be voted on this meeting. The following two policies will reform balances, with the expenses and events policy up next. I am hopeful that the Events Committee will be established in concert with the events policy. 

As part of the Operating Plan 2021 and Events Policy update, we are modeling new trainer profit splits to be fairer on trainers and OWASP. We will ensure that we obtain our trainers' general consent to the new profit splits because we have had feedback that the current settings are not particularly generous. 

**Inactive Chapters Initiative Progress**

We are coming to the end of a 15 month journey to make more chapters active. Just looking at [upcoming Chapter events](https://owasp.org/www-community/meetings/), this initiative has paid off tremendously! We have a level of activity I've not seen since the pandemic began. Sadly, we have identified a small number of truly inactive chapters, who have not responded once in over 20 attempts including non-traditional means over the 15 months. I vacated their leadership last week, to permit us to try out the process for the residual chapters who have communicated with us, but not yet met the four basic requirements to bring them into line with being an active chapter: an up to date owasp.org website, an up to date listing of current chapter leadership, a link to where they organize events, and to have held a single meeting between February 2020 and March 31, 2021. We will work with the Chapters Committee to hold elections or ask new for leadership during April for those chapters who fail to meet these very minimal requirements. If we don't have any luck, we will decommission chapters being de-listed. I have communicated this clearly to the Leaders list, to the OWASP Chapters, Community, and Leaders Slack channels, and to social media. I wish to thank each and every chapter leader who has held meetings and updated their information, because that's the entire point of this exercise, more activity - not delete chapters. We are seeing a resurgence in community as a result of this initiative, and that's exactly why we will be managing to the new Chapter policy after April 1, 2021. 

**Thank you Alonna!**

Lastly, Alonna has just started maternity leave. I wish to thank Alonna for her massive contributions all this year to our events, documenting our processes, and assisting Kelly with handover! The best of luck, Alonna! 

#### Finance

Below is the PRELIMINARY write up for Feb 2021. 

Attached please find the preliminary OWASP Combined (Converted to USD for all reports) financial pkg for Feb 2021 which represents financial performance for the 2nd month of Fiscal year 2021. I have included the 2021 Approved budget which I have spread on a monthly basis.

I have also altered the Board summary to match the categories that the new FY 21 budget highlights. Finally I have included a YOY Balance sheet which we will review at the Board call next week.

Income Statement: 

> Revenue:  On an accrual basis, total revenue, YTD was \$123.1K  as compared to the budget of \$104.2K. The results are Better by \$18.9K, with Conference and Donations, being over budget by \$32K and \$15K respectively. While Merchandise, Trademark and Membership income were a combined <$28K>.
> Expenses:   Total spending YTD 2021 is \$163.8K which is LESS than budget by \$13.6K due to Chapters , Outreach and Project expenses are UNDER budget by \$24K offsetting EDU, WIA, Events, Fundraising and G&A, which combined is over \$10K ( individual accounts have minimal overages).
> Net Income/Loss:  YTD 2021 Net income, on a combined Accrual basis is Negative \$40.7K which is Better than the YTD 2021 APPROVED budget of negative <\$73.2>  by \$32.5K. 
> Chapter Funds: US bal is \$848.6K (down \$1.5K) EU Ch bal is \$64.9K (down \$.2K). US Proj bal is \$208.5K (Up \$10.7K). EU Proj bal is \$-9K

POINTS of NOTE:

Continuing the narrative theme from previous months, as of 2.28.21 our cash position was \$1, 127.1K. Our avg monthly spend for operations is roughly \$82K including all payroll, which is still roughly about 13.7 months of reserve, which is very good in the current environment. If we remove AP and the PPP loan ( \$112.7K of PPP is in the process of being forgiven, however I will keep it here until it is) which totals \$139.7K and is just over 1.7 months of reserve taking, us to an estimated 12 months of Oper. reserve, again a good number. Now the concern is the \$1,113K of Ch/Proj balances. On a good note, Deferred revenue, is starting to build up again at \$120.8K, which is a little over one month of reserve. However the open AR balance is \$112.6K which I am told it is all collectible so that almost offsets the deferred revenue, just mentioned. Through Feb 2021 we are tracking a bit better than budget and we need to keep working on revenue while keeping costs down, while we are still in this no travel environment.

**Eligibility search**

There were 0 people beyond Vandana that are currently affected by the failure of canceled subscriptions to update mailchimp's membership_recurring field. This is the logic I used to determine this; feel free to review:

```
for all the customers in stripe:
     if the customer is a member (membership_type other than None):
          if membership_end_date >= 1/1/2019 and membership_end_date is <= 4/30/2021 (arbitrary date beyond which I hope to have the issue fixed):
                if the member has subscriptions:
                     for each subscription in member's subscriptions:
                           if the subscription is canceled or going to be canceled at the end of the billing period:
                                  if the membership_recurring field is 'no' in Stripe and the membership_recurring field is 'yes' in Mailchimp:
                                           this person is affected and should be added to the list
```

As you can see, it is not trivial. The gist in English: if the person has a subscription that is canceled or is going to be canceled and they are marked not recurring in Stripe but are marked as recurring in Mailchimp then this person will expire as a member and NOT be informed because Mailchimp data is out of sync with Stripe.
