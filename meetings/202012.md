#### Financial

No financial packages as November has not been closed as yet. These will be presented at the January board meeting, along with December's packages.

Tom Pappas will lead the Board through the draft budget, and take your questions as to allocations and ensuring that we meet an 80% program spend objective.

#### Executive Director Report

December is always a month of finalizing projects, big and small before the end of the year. Several motions this month are to ensure that our finances a cleaned up prior to the end of the financial year, including ensuring we have no big event expenses or penalties, helping our corporate supporters during COVID, and resolving negative balances and balances for long term inactive projects and chapters prior to finance reform, thus freeing up funds for other mission activities in our draft 2021 budget.

Tom Pappas, Vandana and myself have been working away on a proposed, very lean, and program centric budget. This budget will be shown and discussed during Tom's officer report. I decided to break the budget into program segments to better show where profits and expenses are coming in, with a goal to help the donor community easily understand what percentage of our annual budget is directed to program, and also for the Foundation to work on ensuring all program areas have the opportunity to  earn income to match their expenses. We look forward to adding merchandise and trademark licensing to our income sources, as well as involving the community in graphic swag designs for the merchandise.

Our staff have been busy working on a policy to procedure initiative, as many policies changed through the policy review process, and it's not clear if we are adhering to those policy objectives. We will be documenting our processes for the community based upon the new policy settings, and ensuring consistency of actions, such as all leaders getting an email address automatically. Once our procedures are documented, it is my intention to manage to policy. I would like the Board's support in managing to policy by preferably either working with us on exceptions, or revising the policy if the exception is the rule. We cannot keep on having "choose your own policy or procedure" - it's confusing and demoralizing to our community and staff alike, as expectations are not being met. We will communicate many of these changes to the community as the procedures are QA'd and approved by myself.

In staffing news, our Events Director, Emily Berman, has decided to leave OWASP and take up a very senior position at a developer-centric events company. We wish Emily all the best, and I think we will all miss her terribly. I thank her for a fantastic virtual events response to COVID throughout 2020. We learnt a lot together, and this will help us throughout 2021 with Alonna and Kelly taking up the reins.

I look forward to meeting with the new Board at a special meeting in mid-January. If you are a continuing or new Board member, please read the non-profit strategic impact book to prepare for this meeting. If you don't yet have a copy, please work with Dawn Aitken to obtain one or simply expense the book (physical or e-book) via the standard mechanism.

Our offices will be closed from the 24th of December, re-opening January 4, 2021. I wish the Board, our members, our leaders, and our Community all the best during the holiday season, and hope we have a much better 2021.

### NEW BUSINESS

#### e-Vote in Executive Session

An e-Vote held in Executive Session was undertaken and passed. The details of this successsful motion has been stored in a Board-only Google Drive folder.

#### Motion to move Dublin to June 2022 and SF to late August/early September 2022

After lengthy negotiations, we have been able to get to a $0 change fee to move Dublin back to June 2022, and San Francisco to late August / early September 2022. This would help ensure that we don't have large cancellation expenses, whilst ensuring that we can advertise and obtain sponsors with some certainty for 2022.

**Motion:** "Resolved, the Foundation is directed to accept the offers to move Dublin to June 2022, and San Francisco to Q3 2022, under the provision that there is no change fee or any associated costs due in 2021."

- Sponsor: TBA
- Second: TBA

#### Motion to reducing corporate to $10k

During COVID, we have experienced a great deal of difficulty in renewing long term sponsors at the $25k tier. We have offered one off COVID discounts to these sponsors, with mixed success. However, $25k turns out to be too much for most of the folks we deal with (CISO's and Head of AppSec), and they have to send $25k for further approvals, even with quarterly or monthly billing. This motion proposes bringing the top tier down to $10k per year for the largest firms for at least one year so we can re-evaluate our corporate supporter tiers and renewal rates. This should also make it easier for upcoming renewals to not rely on arbitrary COVID discounts to get across the line. 

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the Foundation is directed to reduce the top corporate supporter tier to $10k per annum for most countries, and $4k per year for regional pricing."

#### Motion to eliminate negative project and chapter balances

In the lead up to finance reform, there are many chapters and projects with historic negative balances. From the current expense policy, negative balances are equivalent to $0 as both do not permit spending under the pre-reform expense policy. To simplify the handling of balance reform, we propose going into 2021 with a clean balance sheet that contains no negative balances. This will affect X chapters and projects, and forgive $X USD of negative balances.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the Foundation is permitted to forgive all negative project and chapter balances, resetting them to $0."

#### Motion to recover long term inactive project and chapter balances

Inactive projects and chapters are a burden on the Foundation in terms of opportunity cost in using dormant balances to fund actually active chapters and projects, maintaining costly Meetups, staff time in reaching out to unresponsive leaders, and maintaining a historical balance that is unlikely to be used prior to finance reform in early 2021. The Foundation has agreed with the Chapters Committee to not dissolve any chapter before March 31, 2021, and to relax activity requirements from February 1 2020 to March 31 to only require 1 single event or meeting to be deemed as active again. This agreement will not be changed by this motion, as we want as many inactive chapters to get going again.

To allow the Foundation to direct funds from inactive to active chapters and projects, and ensure we can spend further on mission, we propose to zero out balances of all chapters and projects who have not met activity requirements for more than 2 years. The criteria for this motion is that all long term inactive chapters (those who have not met for more than 24 months) or projects that have no GitHub, website, or Google Group activity in 24 months shall continue to exist with the hope they will have new leadership and become active again, but will have their balance reset to $0. This will help clean up the books for FY 2021 and ensure that finance / balance reform can go more smoothly.

During COVID, very few active chapters and few projects have incurred any expenses, totalling $36k in all of 2020. Due to virtual meeting requirements and COVID expense restrictions, there is little chance of these long term inactive chapters or projects incurring expenses even if they re-activate prior to finance reform. In the unlikely event that one of these chapters or projects both re-activates and then incurs a valid expense, we would like the Board's permission to pay the expense despite a proposed $0 balance.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the Foundation is permitted to recover inactive chapter and project balances that have not held an event, or had any activity (for projects), in the last 24 months, resetting them to $0. These chapters and projects will continue to exist per the agreement with the Chapters Committee until the March 31, 2021 deadline, so they can hopefully be revived under the re-activation initiative currently under way. If these currently inactive chapters hold an event or a project becomes active again, and incur any expense policy compliant chapter expenses before finance reform is passed, they will be permitted to expense even with a $0 balance via expense pre-approval."
