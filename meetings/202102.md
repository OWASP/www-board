### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve the updated Chapter Committee Policy

**Background** The Chapter policy has been completely re-written to:

- Document the current policies for the full lifecycle of a chapter for the first time, so chapters can be managed to policy, including how to create, maintain chapter leadership, revive inactive chapters, and finally decomission them
- Document the roles of the Chapter Committee and the Foundation
- Student chapters are defined for the first time, permitting chapters to exist with the assistance of at least one acadmic co-leader, and permitting multiple student chapters in a single city, which is not true of city chapters
- Regional chapters are also defined for the first time, but as "city" chapters until such time as regional chapter policy can be formalized. Defining regional chapters as city chapters allows existing active regional chapters to access expenses and other Foundation services within policy for the first time. No dormant or new regional chapters will be approved under this version of the policy. 
- Expunged all unique chapter policies, differences, references of outdated policies, procedures, or chapter handbook guidance (e.g. how to host a meeting, expenses, and travel policies are all removed), and references to outdated Board resolutions and so on. 
- Lastly, the chapter policy now contains a section on how sanctioned countries or sanctioned leaders are governed in case of sanctions by a country where an OWASP Foundation entity operates, which replaces ad hoc actions taken in the past. The goal is to provide consistency and certainty for members, projects, and chapters, whilst protecting the Foundation from regulatory or legal action, and to ensure that as soon as sanctions are lifted, policy allows the restoration of membership and chapters as permitted. 

A key focus is on serving the needs of our members and the wider community by ensuring that dormant or inactive chapters are revived rather than disbanded.

- [Revised Chapter Policy Consolidated Feedback](TBA)

**Motion** "Resolved, the revised Chapter policy is approved, effective January 26, 2021."
