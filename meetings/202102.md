#### Sponsorship

*Sponsor Survey*

The survey was sent to 15 companies on Tuesday, November 17th. Ten out of the 15 companies who were sent the survey have replied as of today. The results can be found here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-WPP8F6PY/  If you huver of over the question, it will show you the entire question.

I have many companies who are patiently waiting for our 2021 event/activity calendar. With all due respect, I strongly believe the sooner we make a decision the better we will be in 2021.

*Global AppSec Australia*

* After speaking with Daniel and Emily last evening, his impression is if this event were to move forward in Oct 2021 it would most likely be a virtual event.

*Corporate Membership*
* \$55k invoiced for November (so far)

#### Projects & Technology

- Proceeding apace to update OWASP automations and data integrity; somewhat delayed due to unforeseen issues with invalid customer deletion process, updates to membership management and zoom provisioning, and implementing a stronger CAPTCHA on donations.
- Project Graduations are starting to come in from the Project Committee; Project Handbook also being worked on.  Other project details at https://owasp.org/projects/status/
- Event tool will likely see updates prior to the middle of next year to come more in line with Events team and regional event expectations.
- May not be apparent but there is some fantastic work going on pushing/updating the www-community content with much thanks to Rick Mitchell for keeping that moving forward these past few months.
