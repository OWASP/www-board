#### Motion to update links and fianncial packages in previously approved minutes

**Background:** A number of meetings were held early, and we did not receive any financial packages to review. I've discovered that at least one of the minutes is incorrectly linked. 

- [Pull Request](https://github.com/OWASP/www-board/pull/4)

Motion: "Resolved, that for the sake of financial transparency, the Foundation is permitted to alter the minutes from previous meetings to ensure the correct financials and recordings are included in each month, and to ensure all links are functional. Any altered minutes will be presented for review in the February 2020 general meeting."

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve the updated Chapter Committee Policy

**Background** The Chapter policy has been completely re-written to:

- Document the current policies for the full lifecycle of a chapter for the first time, so chapters can be managed to policy, including how to create, maintain chapter leadership, revive inactive chapters, and finally decomission them
- Document the roles of the Chapter Committee and the Foundation
- Student chapters are defined for the first time, permitting chapters to exist with the assistance of at least one acadmic co-leader, and permitting multiple student chapters in a single city, which is not true of city chapters
- Regional chapters are also defined for the first time, but as "city" chapters until such time as regional chapter policy can be formalized. Defining regional chapters as city chapters allows existing active regional chapters to access expenses and other Foundation services within policy for the first time. No dormant or new regional chapters will be approved under this version of the policy. 
- Expunged all unique chapter policies, differences, references of outdated policies, procedures, or chapter handbook guidance (e.g. how to host a meeting, expenses, and travel policies are all removed), and references to outdated Board resolutions and so on. 
- Lastly, the chapter policy now contains a section on how sanctioned countries or sanctioned leaders are governed in case of sanctions by a country where an OWASP Foundation entity operates, which replaces ad hoc actions taken in the past. The goal is to provide consistency and certainty for members, projects, and chapters, whilst protecting the Foundation from regulatory or legal action, and to ensure that as soon as sanctions are lifted, policy allows the restoration of membership and chapters as permitted. 

A key focus is on serving the needs of our members and the wider community by ensuring that dormant or inactive chapters are revived rather than disbanded.

- [Revised Chapter Policy Consolidated Feedback](https://owasp.org/www-staff/files/2021-policy-review-feedback/Policy-Feedback-Chapters.pdf)

**Motion** "Resolved, the revised Chapter policy is approved, effective February 23, 2021."

#### Motion to approve the 2021 Budget

**Background:** Each year, the Foundation sets a budget to match its operating plan and priorities. This year is slightly different, with a survival mode budget. This budget has the lowest expectation of income and expenses for many years, with the expectation that as the vaccination rollout proceeds, life can start to get back to normal, and we might be able to exceed this budget. If that doesn't happen, this budget has a very slim profit, and with careful stewardship of our funds throughout the year, there's every likelihood that we will not make a loss. The major risk is events: the previous events director did not prepare a formal budget, and many of the events had to change. Therefore, we envisage there might be some ad hoc requests for event budgets to allow events to go ahead where the Foundation thinks they will be profitable. The only planned events are LASCON and AppSec Australia, both regional AppSec Days events. Lastly, this budget assumes that there will be finance reform, and therefore makes allowances for limited awards & scholarships, grants, and expenses.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the 2021 OWASP Foundation budget is formally approved."

#### Motion to alter the signing authority of the Executive Director

**Background:** Currently, the Executive Director is authorized to approve a variable amount of funds each quarter without notifying or asking the Board. Although the intent was to ensure the Board was not involved in day to day operational activities, it is somewhat confusing. On more than a few occasions, our accountants have asked for approvals where none were required, and in another case, a couple of expenses were right on the limit and surprised the previous Chair and Treasurer when approved within this policy, but without providing a heads up. There are very few unbudgeted expenses of over $10,000 USD, and therefore, to enhance transparency and oversight, and to simplify the signing authority for all involved, the following signing authority limits are sought to be changed:

Change:

> ~~~The Executive Director, in conjunction with either the Board Chair or the Treasurer may jointly authorize spending on a particular transaction (including integrated or related transactions) exceeding the limits set forth below, up to the approved Quarterly Plan.~~~
> ~~~- Legally binding contractual arrangements, \$ 500,000~~~
> ~~~- General Operational Spending (including but not limited to, payroll, expenses, and accounts payable), \$ 500,000~~~
> ~~~- Transferring funds between and managing OWASP bank accounts and other financial accounts	$ 100,000~~~
> ~~~- Grant making authority	\$ 100,000~~~
> ~~~- Purchasing equipment and assets	\$ 10,000~~~

to

> Budgeted or Discretionary per transaction (or related transactions), grant making, awards and scholarships, expense approvals, legally binding contractual arrangements, and purchasing assets:
> 
> - \$0 - \$10,000 Executive Director can sign and approve without second approver
> - \$10,000 to $250,000 Executive Director and Treasurer or Chair can sign and approve without Board approval
> - \$250,000 or more requires an affirmative Board vote
> 
> Signing authority:
> 
> - Transferring funds between and managing OWASP bank accounts and other financial accounts	\$ 250,000
> - Budgeted General Operational Spending (including but not limited to, payroll, expenses, and accounts payable), \$ 500,000

The intent is that any unplanned discretionary approvals still remains within 10% of the quarterly plan, so if we have a quarterly plan of \$250k, the ED will continue to have a discretionary power to spend up to \$25k per quarter before requiring Board approval to continue with unplanned expenses. We have used that recently for legal fees.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the updated limits in the Signing Authority policy are approved, and shall take effect February 23, 2021."
