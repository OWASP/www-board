### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to change Honorary Lifetime Membership to Distinguished Lifetime Membership

**Background** Previously, Honorary membership was self-nominated, and voted on by the Board. Honorary membership was seen as a way to obtain complimentary membership, which is now provided using self-service complimentary membership. The Board wishes to change honorary membership to recognize outstanding, extraordinary, and lengthy selfless service to the OWASP Community, and to celebrate a few outstanding individuals each year. This change elevates Honorary membership to be that honor.

**Motion** "Resolved, the bylaws shall be amended to change "Honorary Lifetime Membership" to "Distinguished Lifetime Member" per the following pull request."

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve Projects Policy

NB: This policy has not been finalized by the Policy Review team, and may need to be tabled to August.

**Background:** This policy is modelled after the chapter policy, which was approved in January 2021. It documents the lifecycle of a project, and for the first time, how projects can exit OWASP if they so choose. This draft policy, in conjuction with the draft Expenses and recent Grants and Awards and Scholarships policies, replaces the old Project spending policy, which will be removed completely after this approval.

- [Draft Projects Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/projects)
- [Community feedback](https://owasp.org/www-staff/files/2021-policy-review-feedback/Policy-Feedback-Projects.pdf)

**Motion**: "Resolved, the revised Projects Policy is approved, effective September 28 2021."

- Sponsor: Sherif Mansour
- Second: Vandana Verma

#### Motion to approve Events Policy

**Background:** The updated Events policy is part of Event reform that is necessary to allow all parts of OWASP - leaders, local and regional chapters, projects, and committees to run events under the same policy. This policy defines Event leaders as first class leaders of OWASP, with an owasp.org email and access to complimentary membership. It also defines the separate P&L nature of events, formalizing what has always been true, but never stated before. It also defines a seed budget, ($0 required during this approval) to allow bootstrapping of new events and a seed repayment schedule so that events can become self-sustaining and thus lead to new events being created. Lastly, it details how events can direct their portion of the net profits to our mission, and raises the net profit split from 40% to 80%. The new policy defines how events can formally raise exemption requests for a single event with the Board if they disagree with the policy, for the Board's consideration. It also defines a new event type, OWASPx, which will be built by the Foundation after approval to permit members and non-profits to establish OWASP branded events in return for a brand license fee with relevant usage and quality restrictions outlined in the OWASPx program and trademark license agreement.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the revised Events Policy is approved, effective September 28 2021."
