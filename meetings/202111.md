### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to approve Foundation credit cards

**Background:** Currently, the OWASP Foundation has two credit cards under the personal guarantee of Andrew van der Stock. As a result, when large balances exist between months, his personal credit score is negatively impacted. As travel and other expenses are starting to ramp back up, a business credit card solution that is guaranteed by the Foundation is required, including expense receipt management. This e-vote permits the Foundation to obtain $30k of credit to be used amongst staff for approved travel and business expenses.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation Executive Director and CFO are authorized to establish Foundation secured corporate credit cards for staff expenses and travel, with a total limit of $30k USD, replacing the personal guarantee Amex credit cards in use by the ED and one staff member today."

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve a new OWASP Foundation mission

**Background:** The OWASP Foundation has not had a Board approved new mission since its inception. The current version used on IRS and EU tax forms, as well as used by charity rating firms does not reflect the majority of the Foundation's current income, fundraising, and program spending. Additionally, a weak mission does not permit the Foundation or Board to lens activities through the mission, to determine what is a priority or what it should not do. For example, the Foundation should not be in the business of fundraising for animal shelters. Therefore, earlier this year, Grant Ongers took on the mission of drafting a new mission statement. The mission statement has been through extensive rounds of community review.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation's new mission, as linked in the motion background, is approved, effective Novemeber 23, 2021."
