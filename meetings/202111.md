### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to approve Foundation credit cards

**Background:** Currently, the OWASP Foundation has two credit cards under the personal guarantee of Andrew van der Stock. As a result, when large balances exist between months, his personal credit score is negatively impacted. As travel and other expenses are starting to ramp back up, a business credit card solution that is guaranteed by the Foundation is required, including expense receipt management. This e-vote permits the Foundation to obtain $30k of credit to be used amongst staff for approved travel and business expenses.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation Executive Director and CFO are authorized to establish Foundation secured corporate credit cards for staff expenses and travel, with a total limit of $30k USD, replacing the personal guarantee Amex credit cards in use by the ED and one staff member today."

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve a new OWASP Foundation mission

**Background:** The OWASP Foundation has not had a Board approved new mission since its inception. The current version used on IRS and EU tax forms, as well as used by charity rating firms does not reflect the majority of the Foundation's current income, fundraising, and program spending. Additionally, a weak mission does not permit the Foundation or Board to lens activities through the mission, to determine what is a priority or what it should not do. For example, the Foundation should not be in the business of fundraising for animal shelters. Therefore, earlier this year, Grant Ongers took on the mission of drafting a new mission statement. The mission statement has been through extensive rounds of community review.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation's new mission, as linked in the motion background, is approved, effective Novemeber 23, 2021."

#### Motion to remove six month leadership requirement for complimentary membership

As complimentary membership is taken up by less than 70 individuals out of nearly 5300 (< 1.1%), the Foundation wishes to avoid investing any time or resources into complimentary membership, as it represents negative investment in our mission. The policy clause is currently unenforced, and would cost considerably more to create code to enforce it than the Foundation would ever receive in income. The Foundation has consulted with the Policy Review Team and has received advice that this policy change does not need to go through the Policy Review process, as it's a small change.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the six month waiting period for complimentary membership is rescinded from all applicable policies. Additionally, any misspellings of "complimentary" will be fixed."

Change bylaws from

"Complimentary Membership may be offered on an opt-in and automated basis to the top 5 active leaders of any chapter, project, event, or committee that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and has been in the top 5 position continuously for six months prior to applying for complimentary membership. Complimentary Membership is valid for one year. Leaders do not need to accept any offer of complementary leadership. Complementary members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board, but if elected, must maintain good standing with paid Membership. Directors who are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid Membership."
