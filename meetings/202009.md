**Executive Director Report**

This month has been extremely busy, more so than usual:

- The Global Board of Directors election is now underway. Candidates have now been announced, and we are expecting the Candidates to complete video responses to the communities questions.
- AppSec Virtual organizations is well underway, with many speakers having recorded their talks. We are awaiting two keynote speakers to contact us, which is disappointing, but we will continue to work with them, and prepare a Plan B in case of continued non-communication. We appreciate the event sponsors and Corporate Members who are supporting this event, as well as all training and paid attendees.
- Operating Plan 2021 is being finalized. A close to or actually final draft is attached for your reference
- A draft Events strategy is found below. We will not be in a position to choose an option until after AppSec Virtual has concluded and its profitability and impact on our budget is determined. 
- I met with the Board over two weekends on our first virtual face to face. The advice and direction obtained from these meetings has been invaluable.
- Policy Review Committee has addressed many comments and has finalized some of the policies, which should be addressed via the use of e-votes or a future Board meeting
- Due to continuous unresolvable issues with PayPal over the last many months,  hundreds of wasted staff hours, and several outstanding refunds and trainer payments being unable to be processed, we will be deprecating PayPal immediately, with a view to closing all PayPal accounts by the end of the financial year unless tax forms will only be available after the end of the financial year. We will be moving solely to ACH / batch / SWIFT payments, and Stripe. This will help us with financial controls, reduce costs, and prevent delayed payments or refunds to trainers and attendees.

I will prepare with Grant Ongers a revision to the finalized membership policy a revision to allow optional complementary membership for active leaders. After working with the staff, the earliest this could take place is November 1, 2020. Therefore a motion to move these changes will be due at the October board meeting.

**Motion to operationalize temporary infractions of the Code of Conduct** 

Motion: "It is resolved that the Foundation shall draw up a policy to operationalize rapid, escalating, and time limited responses to continued breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct by participants and members. If the behavior is continuous, unlawful, or egregious, the policy should refer to and rely upon the existing bylaw governing the Board's power to revoke membership."

**Motion to approve a new Committee policy**

Background. The Current Committees 2.0 policy doesn't give clear guidance on many topics, including formation, activity, expenses, programs, fidiciary duties, and has a lot of extraneous informational text in there that properly belongs in a Committee Handbook. This policy brings the formation into line with a standing committee documented in RONR 12th Edition 50:7, and makes sure committees are responsible for coming up with a program of works and delivering outcomes, and not just as an advisory board. 

Motion: "It is resolve to promote the creation of additional core committees to enumerate the powers devolved to Committees, with appropriate checks and balances to comply with legal, tax and other regulations and safeguards to protect the Foundation and Board, that the following Committee policy is approved. Existing Committees will transition to the governance model of this Committee policy. OWASP's bylaws should be amended to allow the devolution of certain activities to committees as follows:

Change from

```Establishment. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors in office, establish one or more Advisory Boards or Committees. Committees will be held to the core purpose and core values as outlined in Sections 1.02 and 1.03. Committees will be structured according to the guidelines in Policy and Procedure.```

to

SECTION 5.01 Committees

```Establishment. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors in office, establish one or more Board sub-committees (e.g, fundraising, finance, audit, or executive), Advisory Boards, or Committees. These will be held to the core purpose and core values as outlined in Sections 1.02 and 1.03. Committees are formed and governed by the Committees Policy, and are limited the Charter's purpose and scope. As a Committee Charter might devolve powers currently held by the Board or the Foundation to the Committee, any such devolution to a Committee will require a 2/3rd majority vote.```

**Motion to establish a Project Committee**

**Motion to approve new Operation Plan**

**Discussion on 2021 Events Strategy**

The new events strategy proposes a full calendar of virtual events for the Foundation in 2021. There are two major options, which it is not possible to pick at this time until the financial performance of AppSec Virtual is understood. We will be bringing the Events strategy to a vote in November 2020.
