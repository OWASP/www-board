### Executive Director Report

This month has been extremely busy, more so than usual:

- The Global Board of Directors election is well underway. Candidates have now been announced, and we are expecting the Candidates to complete video responses to the communities questions.
- AppSec Virtual is well underway, with many speakers having recorded their talks. We are awaiting two keynote speakers to contact us, which is disappointing, but we will continue to work with them.
- Operating Plan 2021 is being finalized. A close to or actually final draft is attached for your reference
- I met with the Board over two weekends on our first virtual face to face. The advice and direction obtained from these meetings has been invaluable.

I will prepare with Grant Ongers a revision to the finalized membership policy a revision to allow optional complementary membership for active leaders.
