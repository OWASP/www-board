### NEW BUSINESS

#### Discussion on the OWASP Commercial Entity with Gesmer Lawyers

**Background** Gesmer partners will be joining to discuss / answer questions on the formation of a commercial entity for OWASP.

#### Motion to optimize the Community Review Policy process

**Background** The Community Review Policy process gives 21 days for public comment and a subsequent 30 days for the Policy Review Team to consider the comments and make a recommendation to the Board. This can lead to a long delay in approving policies. This amendment would parallelize the public comment period and the Policy Review Team review period, reducing the overall time to approve policies.

Motion: "Resolved, that the Community Review Policy be amended to conduct the public policy review period and the Policy Review Team review period concurrently."

**Sponsor:** Ricardo Griffith
**Second:** Avi Douglen

#### Discussion chapter leader orientation course

**Background** Sam Stepanyan will discuss the chapter leader orientation course and training, with a view to starting a Working Group to create the course.
