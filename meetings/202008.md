### Financial Report

### Executive Director Report (draft)

The operational plan is slowly coming together, based around three themes: "Survive, Refocus on Mission, and Thrive". I will be making a draft available in the weeks coming. As part of "Survive", I will be ending or discouraging Foundation activities that have limited mission focus, excessive costs for return on investment, or otherwise is not an essential activity that is either not highly visible nor used by our members. We must concentrate our efforts on executing the "Refocus on mission" - doing new things and getting our message out to developers and our industry, and "Thrive", where grants, fundraising, and donations are a key goal.

I've called to schedule a virtual face to face Board meeting. I propose this to be 2 x 4 hour sessions held over consecutive days. Hopefully, by the time of the Board meeting, this will be scheduled. I look forward to seeing you all there. 

I humbly request the Board focus on strategies for the survival of OWASP and our mission. Obviously, in the midst of a pandemic, this can seem like a first world problem, but as Directors, you have a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of the Foundation and our mission. I would dearly love the Board to actively discuss their vision for the future of OWASP with myself and the community, so that we can emerge from the pandemic a stronger Foundation, with deep and integrated links with developers and our industry, and a stronger brand. The focus on day to day drama is hindering our necessary response, and we must come together as one Foundation and put all of these past issues behind us.  

I am saddened over the recent public disputes continuing in relation to decisions made by the Board or the Foundation, or about our bylaws, our policies, and necessary reform. Reform is never easy, but I do ask that the Board after approving various revised policies to get behind that approval as one. The Board's role is to represent all our members, and it cannot do this if after voting concludes, very public discontent, impolite discussion, or dissent continues. The Board voted to institute a Community Review Process, which is now underway, which will help give our community a direct voice in policy reform. The Foundation needs to automate our policies to allow us to scale and grow without more staff and to reduce our overheads.

By the time of the Board meeting, I will have investigated access to ongoing Board education. I hope to make this available to all existing Directors, Candidates, and after the election, our new Directors. I would encourage the Board to review your induction materials, [our bylaws](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws), the [OWASP Board Member Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/board-code-of-conduct), and [Robert's Rules of Order](https://www.boardeffect.com/blog/roberts-rules-of-order-cheat-sheet/). If you are missing either of your induction books, please contact Dawn for a new copy, or please expense a e-book purchase. Dawn can send you the book details if you wish to have it in electronic format. 

In terms of financial risk, we have seen a number of sponsors pull out of AppSec Virtual after a poor Black Hat expo experience for many vendors. I believe our vendor expo platform is better than what I personally experienced at Black Hat. Our events team are working on ways to raise the attractiveness of visiting sponsor booths, especially as all the talks will be available to watch for a 21 day period. We are working on strategies to retain sponsors, including offering a monthly payment model to soften the blow of a huge upfront cost. I will continue to keep you informed. 

## OLD BUSINESS

### Motion: to change bylaws preventing Foundation funds being used to pay for Foundation memberships

"It is resolved that to address the Compliance Committee's recommendation that Foundation funds not be used for membership and that any such paid membership (if any exists) shall constitute a non-voting membership. As this will affect the eligibility of AppSec Cali 2020 attendees who were granted membership paid by the Foundation, this amendment will be effective November 1, 2020. 

Amend section 3.02 (Qualifications) by adding the following italic text:

Foundation funds should not be used to pay for membership. Foundation paid memberships of any class, from any funding source including conferences, chapters, projects, donations, etc, shall not constitute paid membership nor possess voting rights."

## NEW BUSINESS

### Motion to formally adjourn the Special Board Meeting of August 11, 2020

Motion: "It is resolved that after technical issues cut short the Special Meeting before adjournment, the Board motions that the Special Board Meeting of August 11, 2020 is formally adjourned."

Sponsor: TBA
Second: TBA

### Motion to amend or create a policy to formally adopt Robert's Rules of Order

Motion: "The Foundation is directed to create or update any necessary bylaw or policies that govern Board meetings and any associated informative documents to state that Robert's Rules of Order are adopted for OWASP Board Meetings and Special Meetings. Projects, Chapters, and Committees can adopt RRO for their meetings if they so choose, but it is not required by the Foundation."

Add a new clause to Section 3:

"Section 3.1x ADOPTION OF ROBERTS RULES OF ORDER

The rules contained in the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, or the new edition due to be published September 1, 2020, shall govern the OWASP Foundation Board meetings in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the bylaws, and any special rules of order the Board may adopt."

The Foundation is directed to add consistent language to all relevant Board governance policies and Board governance informational pages.

### Motion to affirm expenses related to AppSec Virtual

Background: recently, a milestone payment of $60k was needing to be approved. As this was a budgeted expense in Budget Forecast Z, this was approved by the ED / Chair co-approving the payment under the Signatory Policy 2.0. These amounts were agreed with the original contract signed with the AV company, CEAVCO, back in May. This milestone downpayment allows us to open the registrations and to start the process of speaker recording. The conference budget proposes a potential income of \$742,875.00, and potential expenses of \$276,868.08, for a budgeted profit of \$466,006.92 for AppSec Virtual. A key portion of this profit is due to the AV platform, which covers the recording and editing of speakers' sessions, registrations, expo, training, keynotes, and the event itself. 

Motion: "It is resolved that the expenses for AppSec Virtual's platform should not exceed \$120k without further Board approval, and for the Foundation to notify the Chair and Treasurer if expenses goes over 10% of the approved \$276,868."

### Motion to replace AppSec Dublin as a AppSec Virtual to be held in EU timezones

Motion: "It is resolved that in light of the uncertainties around the COVID pandemic, the Foundation is authorized to make best efforts to cancel under force majeure, or otherwise move the Dublin event booking to 2022, for the least fees possible. The Foundation is directed to replace the physical event with a virtual event to be held at the normal time in May, 2021 to be primarily held or available during normal EU business hours. A revised virtual event budget should be readied for Board approval by September 2021. If the Dublin event is pushed to 2022, Berlin will be the 2023 location for an EU based AppSec, but no contracts or agreements should be signed regarding 2022 or 2023 events until after the revised virtual budget is presented or approved."

Sponsor: TBA
Second: TBA

### Motion to operationalize temporary infractions of the Code of Conduct

Motion: "It is resolved that the Foundation shall draw up a policy to operationalize rapid, escalating, and time limited responses to continued breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct by participants and members. If the behavior is continuous, unlawful, or egregious, the policy should refer to and rely upon the existing bylaw governing the Board's power to revoke membership."

## COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

### Compliance Committee Ruling on Richard Greenberg vote

The Executive Director initiated a Compliance Committee ruling on the result of the Richard Greenberg vote, in part to confirm that the vote is valid (it is), and what the minutes should say, and if we need to formally adjourn the previous special meeting. As a result, there were several discussion points that may lead to future motions. 

The manner of running the Board meetings is not consistent with Robert's Rules of Order and led to a highly contentious vote that had irregulatories under RRO, which sections 7.01 - 7.04 model. The Compliance Committee report on this vote recommmends the Board discuss and consider adopting the following recommendations:

* Our bylaws and policies have no mention of RRO. We need to adopt RRO formally in policy or bylaw to make it clear that we have been and continue to use it.  
* No proxy voting. The State of Delaware (where OWASP was incorporated) does not permit Board proxy voting. As a result of this ruling, Martin's proxy vote in last month's minutes will need to be marked as "Absent" in the minutes, and he will not be considered as part of the quorum of the special meeting. As a result, a recommendation has been made to vote on if we can or should explicitly permit proxy voting, as this has been used by Boards in the past, which when removed from those votes doesn't change the result. As Delaware doesn't permit proxy voting, the easiest path is to not permit it.
* The Board should formally adjourn the special meeting if we are adhering to RRO, which I have made a motion above in New Business. 

As a result of this ruling, this matter on the vote's validity is closed, this Board has spoken, and let's get behind the vote and put this entire episode behind us.
