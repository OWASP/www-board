### Motion: to change bylaws preventing Foundation funds being used to pay for Foundation membesrhips**

"It is resolved that to address the Compliance Committee's recommendation that Foundation funds not be used for membership and that any such paid membership (if any exists) shall constitute a non-voting membership. As this will affect the eligibility of AppSec Cali 2020 attendees who were granted membership paid by the Foundation, this amendment will be effective November 1, 2020. 

Amend section 3.02 (Qualifications) by adding the following italic text:

Foundation funds should not be used to pay for membership. Foundation paid memberships of any class, from any funding source including conferences, chapters, projects, donations, etc, shall not constitute paid membership nor possess voting rights."

Sponsor: Owen Pendlebury, Second: Martin Knobloch
