### Financial Report

### Executive Director Report (draft)

The operational plan is slowly coming together, based around three themes: "Survive, Refocus on Mission, and Thrive". I will be making a draft available in the weeks coming. As part of "Survive", I will be ending or discouraging Foundation activities that have limited mission focus, excessive costs for return on investment, or otherwise is not an essential activity that is either not highly visible nor used by our members. We must concentrate our efforts on executing the "Refocus on mission" - doing new things and getting our message out to developers and our industry, and "Thrive", where grants, fundraising, and donations are a key goal.

I've called to schedule a virtual face to face Board meeting. I propose this to be 2 x 4 hour sessions held over consecutive days. Hopefully, by the time of the Board meeting, this will be scheduled. I look forward to seeing you all there. 

I humbly request the Board focus on strategies for the survival of OWASP and our mission. Obviously, in the midst of a pandemic, this can seem like a first world problem, but as Directors, you have a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of the Foundation and our mission. I would dearly love the Board to actively discuss their vision for the future of OWASP with myself and the community, so that we can emerge from the pandemic a stronger Foundation, with deep and integrated links with developers and our industry, and a stronger brand. The focus on day to day drama is hindering our necessary response. 

I am saddened over the recent public disputes continuing in relation to decisions made by the Board or the Foundation, or about our bylaws, our policies, and necessary reform. Reform is never easy, but I do ask that the Board after approving various revised policies to get behind that approval as one. The Board's role is to represent all our members, and it cannot do this if after voting concludes, very public discontent, impolite discussion, or dissent continues. The Board voted to institute a Community Review Process, which is now underway, which will help give our community a direct voice in reform. The Foundation needs to automate our policies to allow us to scale and grow without more staff and to reduce our overheads.

The manner of running the Board meetings is not consistent with Robert's Rules of Order and led to a highly contentious vote that may need to be re-run. By the time of the Board meeting, I will have investigated access to ongoing Board education. I hope to make this available to all existing Directors, Candidates, and after the election, our new Directors. I would encourage the Board to review your induction materials, [our bylaws](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws), the [OWASP Board Member Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/board-code-of-conduct), and [Robert's Rules of Order](https://www.boardeffect.com/blog/roberts-rules-of-order-cheat-sheet/). If you are missing either of your induction books, please contact Dawn for a new copy, or please expense a e-book purchase. Dawn can send you the book details if you wish to have it in electronic format. 

In terms of financial risk, we have seen a number of sponsors pull out of AppSec Virtual after a poor Black Hat expo experience for many vendors. I believe our vendor expo platform is better than what I personally experienced at Black Hat. Our events team are working on ways to raise the attractiveness of visiting sponsor booths, especially as all the talks will be available to watch for a 21 day period. We are working on strategies to retain sponsors, including offering a monthly payment model to soften the blow of a huge upfront cost. I will continue to keep you informed. 

## OLD BUSINESS

### Motion: to allow Richard Greenberg to stand for election

**From ED: This motion is a placeholder and may disappear depending on the outcome of a Compliance Committee investigation and subsequent recommendations. I hope to have this report to the Board prior to the Board meeting. If the committee recommends no action, this motion will be removed from the proposed agenda. If the committee recommends something other than a re-vote of the previous motion, I will work with the Secretary to table replacement motion(s) per the recommendations for the Board to vote on.**

**Background**. After discussions with staff after the special board meeting, I referred this vote to the Compliance Committee to resolve outstanding issues with the vote itself and the resulting minutes. I believe the vote to not be in compliance with our bylaws, and is likely invalid as a result. As there was extreme confusion, even upon repeated listening as to the result, I felt I had no choice but to get an independent review. This is a cursed issue, because I strongly agree with Richard that we need to move past this, but Richard himself asked for us to adhere to our bylaws. We can't do both. I hope the community understands, because there could be a very different outcome if the vote had been conducted properly per our bylaws and Robert's Rules of Order. I'm investigating Board education resources and the potential for legal counsel to attend our meetings to assist the Board to get back on track. 

I trust that the Board will take the Compliance Committee report into consideration and either follow their recommendations, or simply decide to permanently table this vote and let's move on.

It is easy to ascertain the following facts from our [bylaws](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws), and compare with the [recording of the special Board meeting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-CbNlgDtgx5D38zD9qx7M8NlT5FwUGyz/view): (fast forward to 1:34:07)

* Section 7.02 *"Any conflict of interest shall be disclosed to the Board of Directors by the person concerned. When any conflict of interest is relevant to a matter requiring action by the Board of Directors, the interested person shall call it to the attention of the Board of Directors or its appropriate committee and such person shall not vote on the matter; provided however, any Director disclosing a possible conflict of interest may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof."*

  * In my reading, I believe this means that Richard should have stated that he had a conflict of interest as the motion was sponsored by himself and concerned himself, and thus recused himself from the discussion and vote, as Gary did in the previous related motions. By recusing himself, quorum would have still been maintained (5 present Directors, 1 recused, 1 proxy). 

* Section 7.03 *"Absence from discussion - The person having the conflict shall not participate in the decision regarding the matter under consideration."*

  * Richard should have not discussed the motion or given the floor to state his case, which seems to have influenced at least one Director, and thus the likely outcome. 

* Section 7.04 *"Minutes - The minutes of the meeting of the Board or committee shall reflect that the conflict of interest was disclosed and that the interested person did not vote. When there is doubt as to whether a conflict of interest exists, the matter shall be resolved by a vote of the Board of Directors or its committee, excluding the vote of the person concerning whose situation the doubt has arisen."*

  * After the vote, Dawn asked for clarification of the vote because of the above issues. The discussion quickly ended up in disarray. I believe this disarray caused Martin's proxied vote to be incorrectly directed to be recorded as "Absent", when it should be noted as a "No" with Owen acting as his published proxy. Additionally, the conflict of interest might have led to a different outcome of a tied vote, which the Chair under our bylaws would have the deciding vote. It's now too late to ponder such an outcome as the meeting adjourned... or did it?

* The meeting finished rather abrubtly without adjourning due to a technical issue with the Zoom platform. I have asked the Compliance Committee if the Board needs to vote to formally close the meeting. I consider it obvious to all that the meeting was winding down, and I don't think anyone would consider that we had missed any business on the agenda, but it does breach Robert's Rules of Order, and I would like it to be tidied up. 

I recommend the Board consider the Compliance Committee's recommendations and act on any recommendations, or alternatively, permanently table this motion and move on.

**Motion**: It is resolved to allow Richard Greenberg a one-time exception due to the circumstances of his eligibility and membership to allow him to run for the board in 2020.

### Motion: to change bylaws preventing Foundation funds being used to pay for Foundation memberships

"It is resolved that to address the Compliance Committee's recommendation that Foundation funds not be used for membership and that any such paid membership (if any exists) shall constitute a non-voting membership. As this will affect the eligibility of AppSec Cali 2020 attendees who were granted membership paid by the Foundation, this amendment will be effective November 1, 2020. 

Amend section 3.02 (Qualifications) by adding the following italic text:

Foundation funds should not be used to pay for membership. Foundation paid memberships of any class, from any funding source including conferences, chapters, projects, donations, etc, shall not constitute paid membership nor possess voting rights."

## NEW BUSINESS

### Motion to approve expenses related to AppSec Virtual

Background: recently, a milestone payment of $60k was needing to be approved. As this was a budgeted expense in Budget Forecast Z, this was approved by the ED / Chair co-approving the payment under the Signatory Policy 2.0. These amounts were agreed with the original contract signed with the AV company, CEAVCO, back in May. This milestone downpayment allows us to open the registrations and to start the process of speaker recording. The conference budget proposes a potential income of \$742,875.00, and potential expenses of \$276,868.08, for a budgeted profit of \$466,006.92 for AppSec Virtual. A key portion of this profit is due to the AV platform, which covers the recording and editing of speakers' sessions, registrations, expo, training, keynotes, and the event itself. 

Motion: "It is resolved that the expenses for AppSec Virtual's platform should not exceed \$120k without further Board approval, and for the Foundation to notify the Chair and Treasurer if expenses goes over 10% of the approved \$276,868."

### Motion to replace AppSec Dublin as a AppSec Virtual to be held in EU timezones

Motion: "It is resolved that in light of the uncertainties around the COVID pandemic, the Foundation is authorized to make best efforts to cancel under force majeure, or otherwise move the Dublin event booking to 2022, for the least fees possible. The Foundation is directed to replace the physical event with a virtual event to be held at the normal time in May, 2021 to be primarily held or available during normal EU business hours. A revised virtual event budget should be readied for Board approval by September 2021. If the Dublin event is pushed to 2022, Berlin will be the 2023 location for an EU based AppSec, but no contracts or agreements should be signed regarding 2022 or 2023 events until after the revised virtual budget is presented or approved."

### Motion to operationalize temporary infractions of the Code of Conduct

Motion: "It is resolved that the Foundation shall draw up a policy to operationalize rapid, escalating, and time limited responses to continued breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct by participants and members. If the behavior is continuous, unlawful, or egregious, the policy should refer to and rely upon the existing bylaw governing the Board's power to revoke membership."
