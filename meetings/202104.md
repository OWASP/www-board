### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to requalify candidates

**Background** Given the confused and unclear state of the membership list(s), the recently uncovered corner case where membership status was not correctly communicated, and the uncertainty (of whether one's membership is in good standing or not, whether one can stand for the Board, vote in the elections, or participate as an OWASP leader) attached to that I would like to propose the following motions:

**Motion** "Resolved, that up until the week before the 2022 Board election being called, any member affected any of the following conditions:

- The lack of notification for renewal failing to be sent by the Foundation (for example, as described to the Board during the March public board call);
- The membership renewal service not being operational during an attempt to renew within 24 hours of expiration, and the member then informed the Foundation of this fact; or
- A Foundation-side operation issue which recorded a membership as having expired when it had not

be given one week to correct their membership status from the moment the Foundation informs them of their lapse, and for their membership to be considered uninterrupted for the duration for all intents and purposes."

#### Subsidiary Motion: Single source of truth for membership data

**Background:** Given the confused and unclear state of the membership list(s), the recently uncovered corner case where membership status was not correctly communicated, and the uncertainty (of whether one's membership is in good standing or not, whether one can stand for the Board, vote in the elections, or participate as an OWASP leader) attached to that I would like to propose the following motions:

**Subsidiary Motion:** "Resolved, that the combined unique individuals across the three current sources of membership information (the Foundation's Copper CRM; mailing list, MailChimp; and automated payment system, Stripe) for whom an expectation of active membership exists, be considered fully qualified members in good standing as of the 1st of June 2021. These three lists are merged into a single source of truth. Any cases of doubt (around the validity of membership or remaining duration of membership) be resolved in favor of the member concerned.

### COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

#### Discussion on good standing bylaw changes

**Background**: The Foundation Staff disagree with how the main and subsidiary e-vote motions have been framed. The motions read as a failure by the Foundation, rather than as a failure by candidates or Director in a difficult to enforce and apply bylaw rule. The Foundation Bylaws and Director's Commitment Agreement both require the Director to maintain good standing. There is nothing in our bylaws or policies that requires the Foundation to notify a Board member or candidate of their membership renewal or ensure that our technical systems are functional. We have technical systems in place to determine if the message was received and opened. Additionally, there have been no examples of the second point since the new system became operational in February 2020. We have corrected all of the third points.

The Foundation staff urge the Board to reform the bylaws around eligibility and good standing. The goal should be to make it simpler and more equitable for candidates and remove reliance on technical systems. The Board could do such a change by removing the 12-month prior good standing and requiring all Board members to have either auto-renewing membership or pre-pay membership dues to the end of their term or become a lifetime member. 

These bylaw changes would reduce barriers to becoming a Board member, improve equity to allow all members to run, including leaders moving from complimentary membership. The grace provision protects Directors in case of Director card expiry or technical faults. Operationally, these changes eliminate manual detection of membership lapses, implied requirements to provide notifications. Lastly, it reduces the number of technical systems and processes required to function to just the payment system. 

Proposed Change:

Section 3.02 - Replace:

"A Director or Candidate for the Board shall have maintained continuous membership in good standing over the previous 12 months, notwithstanding any grace periods established in these bylaws.

At the time of their election, to qualify to stand, candidates must hold an Individual membership, Lifetime membership, or hold a valid Honorary Membership. This membership must have been in place for a 12 month period prior to the date of the election."

to:

"All Directors shall have continuous individual paid membership throughout their term. Successful candidates and Directors should use one of 
the membership auto-renew feature; 
Pre-paying membership to cover the entirety of their term; or 
Obtain paid Lifetime or Honorary Lifetime membership. 

Director membership will be validated by the OWASP Foundation no later than the first week of January each year and reported to the Secretary at the first Board meeting."

Section 3.15 - Replace:

"Directors and Candidates for the Board who have lapses in good standing have a grace period of 7 days to renew their membership. Directors or Candidates who fail to obtain paid individual or lifetime membership, honorary membership, or renew their previous membership within the permitted grace period will not have maintained good standing for the purposes of election eligibility. Directors may continue to vote on the Board during the grace period."

with:

"If a Director fails to pay their membership auto-renewal, such as credit card expiry, they will have seven days to remedy the situation. If a Director fails to pay their dues after seven days, they will become ineligible to stand in an upcoming election. If a technical issue around the auto-renewal system occurs, the Foundation will have seven days to rectify the technical fault. Any affected Director will be deemed to be in good standing if action is taken to remedy the situation, and their membership considered continuous during that time."

#### Tax discussion on merchandise sales for 501 (c) 3 entities

Tom Pappas will answer your questions around the pros, cons, and issues surrounding merchandise sales supporting our mission.

#### Presentation from Lisa Jones

Lisa Jones will give a short presentation on the results of the March membership drive and the current status of the Chapter Activity Initiative, including some issues and concerns that have arisen as a result of leaders choosing their own interpretation of policy or wilfully misinterpreting statements as policy.

##### Agenda and Scheduling the next executive session

In prior years, the Board has met at AppSec Global events to discuss longer and important strategic topics. Let's quickly discuss a time to hold this in May and September / October with the wider Board. Please forward agenda topics, such as Federated OWASP entities, to Andrew van der Stock to be included on the agenda.
