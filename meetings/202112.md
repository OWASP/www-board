### e-Votes to read into minutes

#### Motion to replace the Foundation credit cards

**Background:** Currently, the OWASP Foundation has a $10k credit limit with two card holders personally guaranteed by the OWASP Executive Director. As the world opens up, and travel resumes, and as some of the Foundation's monthly expenses rise, we regularly need to pay down the credit cards before the due date. Additionally, the activity is negatively affecting Andrew's credit score. A better solution is for the OWASP Foundation to apply in its own right to a financial institution for new cards.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation Executive Director and CFO are authorized to establish Foundation secured corporate credit cards for staff expenses and travel, with a total limit of $30k USD, replacing the personal guarantee Amex credit cards in use by the ED and one staff member today."

### NEW BUSINESS



### COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

#### Regional Chapter Policy

I will invite the Chapter committee to give a briefing to the Board, but it is important that we either formalize regional chapters or abolish them.

**Background** Regional chapters have never existed in any OWASP policy or bylaws, and as such are a policy anomaly and should never have been approved or exist. However, they are some of the largest, most active, and oldest chapters, and beloved by their members for the most part. So we need a policy that meets OWASP community management objectives, such as "no chapter is the boss of any other chapter", "chapters can't stop other chapters from existing", meet chapter activity requirements, access to expenses and shared services, and how best to integrate and work together within a region. Additionally, as we don't have a policy, management of regional chapters varies dramatically all over the world. No two regional chapters are the same.

In the past, we have seen negative behavior with some using regional chapters for their resume or Linked In profile with no activity, or trying to dominate or lock out other chapters and chapter leaders by saying they are the leaders of the country or region. 

We need a regional chapter policy that enshrines how they are established, led, and their boundaries from a policy and geographic perspective. As the Foundation is writing our business requirements for a new association management system, regional chapters need to have a documented model that is amenable to self-service and automation using the same AMS as city and student chapters. Without a policy, we cannot include regional chapter requirements in our selection, so this has become urgent to resolve.

The chapter committee was first asked to address the regional chapter problem in [September 2020](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FDVbggGL1wLCU97vToqEOkdDRfASt_L5UYcpYRLpTmE/edit#heading=h.w7uwrkjo48c2). They have consulted widely with the community and have a model, but no policy. 

**The ask.** We need a discussion between the Chapter Committee and decision from the Board to urgently resolve this issue, otherwise, regional chapters will not likely to be supported by the new association management software unless they appear to be exactly like OWASP city or student chapters. At that stage, if the city model doesn't fit, the only remaining solution is to either ignore the differences, which means they are all but city chapters, or abolish regional chapters and reform them into many smaller city chapters.
