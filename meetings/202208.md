### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to ratify new bylaws

**Background** The new bylaws have been returned from legal review. It is now time to socialize these with the membership, and pursue the various methods of ratification proposed by our lawyers:

- Ratification by all current and previous Directors
- Ratification by a majority of current Members (3000)
- Ratification by petitioning the Delaware Court of Chancery

Motion: "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation shall work through the ratification of the new bylaws in order suggested by OWASP's legal counsel."

#### Motion to increase dues

**Background** OWASP has not had a price rise since 2008, when fees were reduced from \$120 per year to the current \$50. The price increase is intended to support the ongoing development of the OWASP Foundation, our mission, and support projects, chapters, members and events. When inflation is taken into account, \$50 2008 dollars is \$70 in 2022 dollars, so this increase in dues does not catch up with inflation.

We propose to increase the dues per the following table:

| Description | Current | New |
|---------|-----| ---- |
| Individual | $50     | $60 |
| Two Year  | $95 | $110 |
| Lifetime | $500 | $550 |
| Regional | $20 | No change |
| Student | $20 | No change |
| Regional Student | $8 | No change |

**Motion:** "Resolved, that the Board of Directors shall increase the dues per the table in the motion, as of November 14, 2022."

**Sponsor:** TBA
**Second:** TBA
