### NEW BUSINESS

#### Motion to approve the Events Committee

**Background:** The Events Committee will assist leaders and participants to hold high quality local and regional activities and events. It will assist the Foundation with maintaining a program committee, and assist with sourcing and organizing volunteers and so on for global events. The Committee will also advise the Board on the Events and associated policies, along with maintaining [Events in a Box](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzfE50R_xamKnvG1Jdav0HmBWFhpBIG7NuPRZnQ4He8/edit?usp=sharing), and improving virtual, local, and regional budget templates and processes. There are representatives from the Events Committee here today if you have any questions.

- [Events Committee Charter draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2HiBuqh7ZmJn_Tn0WFmdm9A-JcIGbxjJfxEXPORPvc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Motion**: "Resolved, the Events Committee is approved with the above charter."

#### Motion to approve the Foundation to apply for an EIDL loan of up to $150k USD

**Background:** The US Government's Small Business Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is a low cost loan facility for small businesses and non-profits. The purpose of applying for this loan type is to ensure that we have spare funds to ensure that we can weather the economy long enough to become profitable again in our own right. The loans are inexpensive, around $5500 per year in repayments over 30 years, and can be repaid early with no penalties. If we choose not to use the funds, we can simply pay the funds back. Below $150k, the EIDL compliance requirements are far less, and we envisage that this should be sufficient to see us through. We would use them on paying the large deposits and installments for AppSec Dublin 2022, AppSec San Francisco 2022, and LASCON 2021, all of which are due to be paid by May 2022. These deposits and installments far exceed the $150k of the loan, and the EIDL loan will ensure that these usually profitable events can take place, and smooth our cash flow during what is normally a very income sparse H1 2022. Assuming AppSec Dublin and AppSec San Francisco are profitable as per our global events typical profitability, we should be in a position to repay the loan partially or fully in late 2022, or early 2023.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the Foundation is permitted to apply for an EIDL loan, to the maximum value of $150k, to be paid back per the loan terms of up to 30 years at 2.7% APR. The loan shall be earmarked to pay for event expenses, primarily event location deposits and installments."

#### Motion to approve the updated Conflict of Interest Policy

**Background:** The Conflicts of Interest Policy is a necessary element to provide integrity to many of OWASP's policies and processes. The Conflict of Interest policy was written primarily by Schwabe lawyers, with a re-write of the frontispiece by Andrew van der Stock. So far, no comments have been received.

**Motion**: "Resolved, the Conflict of Interest Policy is approved."
