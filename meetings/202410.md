### e-Votes and Special Meeting Motions to read into minutes

#### Motion to sign the Barcelona Convention Center Agreement for OWASP AppSec EU 2025

**Background**Background: This is an e-vote to allow the Treasurer and Executive Director to review, approve, and co-sign the Barcelona convention center contract for AppSec EU 2025, to be held in late May 2025. The current value of the contract is 150,000 euro, but staff are reviewing and getting edits to the contract, which may affect the price a little (+/- 5-10%), so a maximum ask is 200,000 euro to allow an e-vote to go ahead.
