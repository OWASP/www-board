No e-votes recorded since December's Board meeting. 

### Motion to elect nominated 2021 Board Officers

**Background** During the executive session of the January Special Meeting, the new Board met to discuss nominations from the floor. The following Board members were nominated on the day. A formal vote confirming these positions in a properly convened Board meeting is required by the bylaws. As these nominations are not binding, additional nominations can be called for each position per RONR (12th) 46:18.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that Sherif Mansour will be elected as 2021 Chair."

(To satisfy RONR 46:20, further nominations are of the form "Are there any further nominations for < office >? If not, nominations are closed.")

Note: Per RONR (12th ed) 46:47, the 2020 Chair opens the meeting, but at the conclusion of this vote, the office of Chair passes immediately to the new Chair, and the remainder of this meeting will be chaired by the new chair.

### Motion to confirm re-charter of Education Committee

**Background** During the preparation of the minutes, it became clear despite the item being clearly about approving the Education Committee charter, extended discussion with the Education Committee members present, the vote wasn't for any particular motion. The vote was unanimous. This motion resolves the confusion, and will allow the minutes to be updated to reflect the results of that previous vote. 

**Motion** "Resolved, the 2021 Board confirms the unanamious vote by the 2020 Board to approve the Education Committee charter. The following motion shall be entered into the minutes of the December 2020 meeting: "Resolved, the Education Committee charter is approved, effective December 15, 2020."
