### Executive Director Report

January has been a busy month so far, including holding two half day virtual meetings to discuss Board strategy. A number of items will result in our activities in the coming months, including creating a new mission statement and a complete review of our bylaws. I have business below to identify Board members who are willing to assist or lead these efforts. 

I welcome Kelly Santalucia to her new position as Director of Events and Corporate Support. Kelly has been with the Foundation for over a decade, and has a wealth of experience working with our community to deliver tremendously successful events. I hope that we can return to community-run global, regional, and local events soon. Our most profitable, largest, and most mission accomplished events all had a high level of community activism, volunteers, and support. We need to get back to those days, whilst incorporating the best of what we've learnt about virtual events in the last 12 months.

Our team has been using the typically "quiet" January month to get member benefits moving forward. For example, OWASP merchandise, online books, and other activities will go live shortly, moving our operating plan forward quite nicely. 

I encourage the Board to finalize the planning poker game to prioritize the rest of this year's operating plan. There's so much to do, and I would like to involve the community in delivering these improvements to our mission by focusing our collective efforts on strategically important deliverables and outcomes, rather than just perceived urgent activities of limited value. 

## OLD BUSINESS

### Status reports from December Board meeting

1. Due to a lack of formal budgets created by the previous Director of Events, the Budget 2021 is being updated with a more accurate events budget. It will be ready for an e-vote between now and February or at the February Board meeting. 
2. Automated roadmap presentation is being presented today in this meeting
3. Vandana's blog articles have been published, and will continue to be published as BAU. I have sought additional authors, and we have published blogs from Steve Springett and the OWASP Zap team
4. Social media via HootSuite is now back with the Foundation, and we've been using it to promote these articles
5. The announcement of Secure Flag member benefit was sent out on December 24, 2020. The benefit is now available world wide
6. Board Source training - please complete the certificate of training and provide to Dawn Aitken
7. Board prep. We have concluded these meetings

## NEW BUSINESS

### Motion to elect nominated 2021 Board Officers

**Background** During the executive session of the January Special Meeting, the new Board met to discuss nominations from the floor. The following Board members were nominated on the day. A formal vote confirming these positions in a properly convened Board meeting is required by the bylaws. As these nominations are not binding, additional nominations can be called for each position per RONR (12th) 46:18.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that Sherif Mansour will be elected as 2021 Chair."

(To satisfy RONR 46:20, further nominations are of the form "Are there any further nominations for Chair? If not, nominations are closed.")

Note: Per RONR (12th ed) 46:47, the 2020 Chair opens the meeting, but at the conclusion of this vote, the office of Chair passes immediately to the new Chair, and the remainder of this meeting will be chaired by the new chair.

### Motion to confirm re-charter of Education Committee

**Background** During the preparation of the minutes, it became clear despite the item being clearly about approving the Education Committee charter, extended discussion with the Education Committee members present, the vote wasn't for any particular motion. The vote was unanimous. This motion resolves the confusion, and will allow the minutes to be updated to reflect the results of that previous vote. 

- [Education Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ffzXfpCzaoNzscD4F-B_71qsPOY6P0M2vwoP8SCueU/edit)

**Motion** "Resolved, the 2021 Board confirms the unanamious vote by the 2020 Board to approve the Education Committee charter. The following motion shall be entered into the minutes of the December 2020 meeting: "Resolved, the Education Committee charter is approved, effective December 15, 2020."

- Sponsor: Grant
- Second: Sherif

### Motion to approve the updated Chapter Committee Charter

**Background** The Committees policy recently changed, which requires existing Committees to present an updated charter, and ensure that they have between 3 and 5 officers, these officers can only sit on one committee and may not be from the Board or the Foundation. The charter from the Chapters Committee is derived from the previously approved scope. Chapter Committee representatives are present for discussion or any questions relating to the charter or scope. 

- [Revised Chapter Committee Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMKKCLqW8dqRLSWvTjnrWSOc43M7jRUYe-9vthigniY/edit?ts=600a821a)

**Motion** "Resolved, the revised Chapter Committee charter is approved, effective January 26, 2021."

- Second: TBA

### Bylaw changes relating to Code of Conduct to comply with Delaware Law

**Background** Schwabe reviewed our Codes of Conduct and bylaws in relation to the confidential investigation last year. As a result, they made a number of recommendations to improve compliance with Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), which governs our bylaws. The found that our bylaws in relation to director removal were not compliant with the law, and thus the Board could not use these provisions. 

 The following motions should be voted on as a whole. 

#### Main motion

"Resolved, the Board by 2/3rd affirmative vote, adopts Schwabe's recommendedations to updates to the Foundation's bylaws and Director's Code of Conduct relating to Director Removal and Harrassment."

#### Subsidiary motion: Amend Director Removal bylaws to comply with Delaware General Corporation Law

**Background** The provisions for Director Removal weren't compliant with DGCL. These amendments bring our bylaws into line with the DGCL, ensuring consistency that the Board votes to recommend Director removal, which is then put to a member vote to actually remove the Director. 

"Resolved, the Board directs the Foundation to update OWASP's bylaws as per the following text within 30 days to become compliant with the Delaware General Corporate Law."

*Section 2.04*

“Directors may be removed from office by the members, with or without Cause, as permitted by and in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The Board will recommend to the Members that a Director be removed from office when there is a finding that a Director has committed an action that results in a finding of “Cause.” A determination of “Cause” by the Board of Directors requires an affirmative vote of the full number of voting Directors then in office, except for the Director being considered for removal. For the purpose of these Bylaws the term “Cause” shall mean 

(w) repeated violations of the Board Code of Conduct Policy or 
(x) a final conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude or 
(y) willful misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to OWASP or 
(z) a no confidence vote by the Board of Directors under Section 3.04 of the Bylaws. 

For purposes of the definition of “Cause,” no act, or failure to act, by a Director shall be considered “willful” unless committed in bad faith and without a reasonable belief that the act or failure to act was in the best interest of OWASP. As voting by OWASP Members is optional, a simple majority of votes received by members in good standing shall govern if the Director is removed.” 

*Section 3.03 Regular meetings*

The Board of Directors shall have regular meetings as needed. A link to the board meeting agenda’s and the historical minutes is here: https://owasp.org/www-board/. Meetings shall be at such dates, times, and places as the Board shall determine in December of the preceding year and as amended by the Board. In no event will there be less than one meeting per quarter. These meetings will be open to public attendance, however, certain portions of the meeting may be closed to board members and their delegates when required for legal reasons, or to shield liability, or to handle personnel issues, or similar.

Attendance in person or virtually by board members is required at no less than 75% of the total meetings each year and shall be highly encouraged to meet in person at least once annually at a date to be announced and agreed upon. To be considered as “attended” the board member must attend at least 90% of the meeting, starting at the published scheduled time until the published end time or the meeting is adjourned (whichever is earlier). Attendance is tabulated by the Executive Director or delegate within seven days after every scheduled meeting for the purpose of determining if the 75% attendance requirement has been met, and the tabulation is based upon the entire calendar year. Cancelled meetings are considered attended for the purposes of the tabulation. 

Failure by a board member to meet the 75% attendance requirement after any tabulation will cause a mandatory vote of confidence by the remaining board members, whose votes will be publicly recorded. ~~The vote of confidence is to take place within 21 days, but not sooner than 7 days, of notification by the Executive Director or delegate that a board member has not met the attendance threshold. During the first seven days, the board member in question will have an opportunity to make their case to their fellow board members. The vote of confidence will take place on the OWASP Board of Directors email list, unless the Board votes to review the matter at their next meeting, so long as the next meeting occurs within the 21­day window. An overall vote of “no confidence” is recorded if more than half of the board members vote for it, which causes the board member in question to be instantly removed from their seat on the board.~~ If a vote of confidence does not pass, the Board will put a vote of removal and recommend to the members to remove the Director, per section 2.04. 

#### Subsidiary motion: Amend the Director's Code of Conduct to address harassment and repeated violations

**Background** The Director's Code of Conduct did not have anti-harassment provisions, and the consuequnce of repeated violations with Delaware law was not legal. This addition and amendment to the Director's Code of Conduct resolves both issues. 

"Resolved, that the Foundation is directed to amend the [Board of Directors Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/board-code-of-conduct) to include or change the following clauses:

“**Anti-Harrassment**

Board members must not engage in any intimidating, harassment, discriminatory, abusive, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions (“harassment” includes, but is not limited to: communication or conduct that a reasonable person in the individual’s circumstances would consider unwelcome, intimidating, hostile, threatening, violent, abusive or offensive, such communication may be related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, race, age, religion; it also includes stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention).”

*... and replace the following text...*

"**Sanctions**

~~Board Members Behavior and Conduct - Board Members who intentionally and repeatedly do not follow proper conduct may be reprimanded or formally censured by the Board.~~ Repeated violations of the Board Code of Conduct, the Board can take the step of recommending the Removal of a Director under Bylaw Section 2.04."

## COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND OTHER BUSINESS

### Chapter Policy deferred to February 2021

The Chapter Policy had a significant amount of feedback, which is in the process of being incorporated. As this is the first rewrite of Chapter policy in some time, I would prefer if the Board had a period of time to fully review the Chapter policy before approving it. 

### Bylaws Review Sub-Committee

I am seeking at least one and no more than three Board members to lead the effort to review and reconcile the lawyer's review of our bylaws. There's a significant number of changes that need to be merged, which will result in a vote of a completely redrafted bylaws, including recent changes as outlined above, within the next 60 days (to be approved at March's Board meeting). 

### Mission Statement Sub-Committee

As discussed in the January strategy meetings, OWASP needs to overhaul its mission statement to focus our energies on the challenges of the next 20 years, not the last 20. The mission statement should be straightforward and impactful, and if we are doing it correctly, will lead to much needed improvements in application security. I am seeking 1-3 Board members to join the sub-Committee to work with myself and the Community in drafting a new mission statement within the next 90 days (to be approved at April's Board meeting). 

### Automation Roadmap Presentation

Harold Blankenship will lead the Board through a discussion on what has been achieved to date, with a list of planned automation and self-service activities. As there is much to do, discussion and feedback from the planning poker game to assist in selecting what next to work on will be highly desirable at the end.
