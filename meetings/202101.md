### Motion to elect nominated 2021 Board Officers

**Background** During the executive session of the January Special Meeting, the new Board met to discuss nominations from the floor. The following Board members were nominated on the day. A formal vote confirming these positions in a properly convened Board meeting is required by the bylaws. As these nominations are not binding, additional nominations can be called for each position per RONR (12th) 46:18.

**Motion:** "Resolved, that Sherif Mansour will be elected as 2021 Chair."

(To satisfy RONR 46:20, further nominations are of the form "Are there any further nominations for < office >? If not, nominations are closed.")

Note: Per RONR (12th ed) 46:47, the 2020 Chair opens the meeting, but at the conclusion of this vote, the office of Chair passes immediately to the new Chair, and the remainder of this meeting will be chaired by the new chair.

### Motion to confirm re-charter of Education Committee

**Background** During the preparation of the minutes, it became clear despite the item being clearly about approving the Education Committee charter, extended discussion with the Education Committee members present, the vote wasn't for any particular motion. The vote was unanimous. This motion resolves the confusion, and will allow the minutes to be updated to reflect the results of that previous vote. 

**Motion** "Resolved, the 2021 Board confirms the unanamious vote by the 2020 Board to approve the Education Committee charter. The following motion shall be entered into the minutes of the December 2020 meeting: "Resolved, the Education Committee charter is approved, effective December 15, 2020."

### Motion to approve the updated Chapter Committee Charter

**Background** The Committees policy recently changed, which requires existing Committees to present an updated charter, and ensure that they have between 3 and 5 officers, these officers can only sit on one committee and may not be from the Board or the Foundation. The charter from the Chapters Committee is derived from the previously approved scope. Chapter Committee representatives are present for discussion or any questions relating to the charter or scope. 

- [Revised Chapter Committee Charter](TBA)

**Motion** "Resolved, the revised Chapter Committee charter is approved, effective January 26, 2021."

- Sponsor: TBA
- Second: TBA

### Motion to approve the updated Chapter Committee Policy

**Background** The Chapter policy has been completely re-written to:

- Document the current policies for the full lifecycle of a chapter for the first time, so chapters can be managed to policy, including how to create, maintain chapter leadership, revive inactive chapters, and finally decomission them
- Document the roles of the Chapter Committee and the Foundation
- Student chapters are defined for the first time, permitting chapters to exist with the assistance of at least one acadmic co-leader, and permitting multiple student chapters in a single city, which is not true of city chapters
- Regional chapters are also defined for the first time, but as "city" chapters until such time as regional chapter policy can be formalized. Defining regional chapters as city chapters allows existing active regional chapters to access expenses and other Foundation services within policy for the first time. No dormant or new regional chapters will be approved under this version of the policy. 
- Expunged all unique chapter policies, differences, references of outdated policies, procedures, or chapter handbook guidance (e.g. how to host a meeting, expenses, and travel policies are all removed), and references to outdated Board resolutions and so on. 
- Lastly, the chapter policy now contains a section on how sanctioned countries or sanctioned leaders are governed in case of sanctions by a country where an OWASP Foundation entity operates, which replaces ad hoc actions taken in the past. The goal is to provide consistency and certainty for members, projects, and chapters, whilst protecting the Foundation from regulatory or legal action, and to ensure that as soon as sanctions are lifted, policy allows the restoration of membership and chapters as permitted. 

A key focus is on serving the needs of our members and the wider community by ensuring that dormant or inactive chapters are revived rather than disbanded. 

- [Revised Chapter Policy](TBA)
- [Revised Chapter Policy Consolidated Feedback](TBA)

**Motion** "Resolved, the revised Chapter policy is approved, effective January 26, 2021."
