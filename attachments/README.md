Place all Board Meeting attachments in this folder. Please note for pages to work correctly you **MUST** use proper naming conventions as in:

yyyymm-WhateverNameYourWantWithWhateverExtension

So if you have the monthly financials it could be: yyyymm-financials.xls. The month and year is for when the file was presented to the board, not necessarily the period of the report. So financials for October are presented to Board as a report in November. So that filename would start with yyyy11 NOT yyyy10.

Note that MINUTES and RECORDINGS have their own folders and items placed there have the same naming conventions.
