  location: United Kingdom
  description: Co-founder of Secure Delivery and current OWASP Global Foundation board member, Grant Ongers ([@rewtd](https://twitter.com/rewtd)), is a firm believer in security enabling delivery not blocking it. Well-known in the international InfoSec community (it's hard to forget the beard!), his 10+ years of experience in Dev, 20 years in Ops and 30 years in Sec (mostly white hat) has made him a firm believer that there's no such thing as DevSecOps - just DevOps done right, and that compliance != security (or the other way around). Alongside his role as CTO within Secure Delivery, Grant provides C-suite advice and guidance on security to FTSE100 enterprises and strategic risk analysis within M&A diligence teams.</br>
