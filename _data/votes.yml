  motion:  "Resolved, the Board directs the Foundation to provide automated complimentary Membership to the top 5 active leaders of chapters, projects, events, and committees, effective November 1st, 2020, and monthly after that. Honorary Membership will become an award made by the Board, and changed to be for five years in recognition of extraordinary service to the OWASP Community. Regional pricing will be made available to all classes of paid Membership.
            <br>The following bylaw amendment is required to support this change in membership model:
            <br>SECTION 4.01 Membership Classes
            <br>There shall be the following classes of OWASP members: Corporate, Individual, Complimentary, Honorary, and Student. 
            <br>SECTION 4.02 Qualifications
            <br>Individual, Corporate, and Student Membership may be granted to any individual or organization that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good  standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and pays the dues as set by the Board of Directors. The Foundation may, at its discretion, offer monthly, annual, two-year, and Lifetime memberships. Regional pricing is available to all paid membership classes.
            <br>Complimentary Membership may be offered on an opt-in and automated basis to the top 5 active leaders of any chapter, project, event, or committee that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and has been in the top 5 position continuously for six months prior to applying for complimentary membership. Complimentary Membership is valid for one year. Leaders do not need to accept any offer of complementary leadership. Complementary members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board, but if elected, must maintain good standing with paid Membership.  Directors who are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid Membership.
            <br>Honorary Membership is equivalent to Individual Membership and valid for five years. Honorary Membership shall be determined and approved solely by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for long-standing and extraordinary services to the OWASP Community.
            <br>All membership classes are eligible to vote in elections.  Sherif Mansour motions, Owen Pendlebury seconds

  motion:  "Resolved, that the Foundation shall draw up a policy to operationalize rapid, escalating, and time limited responses to continued breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct by participants and members. If the behavior is continuous, unlawful, or egregious, the policy should refer to and rely upon the existing bylaw governing the Board's power to revoke membership.
            <br>The following should be added to the Code of Conduct policy to enable sanctions:
            <br>Sanctions
            <br>The Executive Director can suspend participation in OWASP for 30 days for perceived or actual breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct or US law. Depending on the severity of the breach, the member or participant can accept the 30-day suspension, or in serious cases, the member or participant will be referred to the Compliance Committee for a decision regarding their ongoing participation or membership by the OWASP Board at the next available Board meeting. 
            <br>For first time Code of Conduct breaches where no violation of US law has occurred: The member or participant can agree to comply with a temporary suspension imposed by the Executive Director of all OWASP participation for no more than 30 days. Membership will not be extended to cover the suspension.
            <br>For repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or where a participant has been charged with a crime, the Executive Director must suspend the member, refer the matter to the Compliance Committee, who will make an independent evaluation on if the Board should strip leadership, revoke participation, or membership privileges. The period of suspension will remain in place until after the Board votes on the matter.
            <br>If the Board decides to take no action, full participation can resume immediately. If the participant is a member, their membership will be extended by the period of the suspension served.
            <br>Transparency and Oversight
            <br>To provide transparency and oversight of sanctions, the Executive Director will inform the Board privately of the actions being taken under these sanctions, informing the Compliance Committee as required, and providing recommendations from the Compliance Committee to the Board and scheduling a vote as necessary.

            <br>SECTION 2.05 Vacancies
            <br>A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term.
            <br>If a Director creates a Vacancy, such as being removed or resigned, the entire term is considered served for that Member for the purposes of term limits.
            <br>
            <br>SECTION 3.10 Vacancies
            <br>Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors unless otherwise provided by law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes then the ultimate determination shall be made by the then­ sitting Chairman of the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the Directors.
