## Onboarding for new Board Members

In the week after a new Board member has been elected, the OWASP Foundation will work with you to get your address to ensure everyone has received the Board induction books and Board Source either electronically or physically. There's a great Board training series on Board Source, which we need you to complete. Dawn will send you the instructions on how to sign up for it.

The current induction resouces and books are:

- [Nonprofit Kit For Dummies 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119835720/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised 12th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Roberts-Rules-Order-Newly-Revised/dp/1541736699/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=roberts+rules+of+order+newly+revised+12th+edition&qid=1642176682&sprefix=roberts%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-1) or the [Concise version](https://www.amazon.com/Roberts-Rules-Order-Newly-Revised/dp/1541797701/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=roberts+rules+of+order+newly+revised+12th+edition&qid=1642176682&sprefix=roberts%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-4).
- [Board Source online training](https://boardsource.org/my-account/trainings/). A registration link will be given to all Board members, and they should undertake the training certificate found by clicking "My account" at the top, "Training" on the left side, and then "Certificate of Nonprofit Board Education Series". It will take approximately an hour. Please provide the certificate to the Operations Manager before signing the Commitment agreement.

The Nonprofit Kit has sections relevant to the staff, and sections that are more relevant to the Board. It is recommended to read the entire thing, but as a Board member please read and understand Chapter 3: Prioritizing Your Board of Directors, Chapters 7-10, Chapter 12 Budgets, Chapter 13 Marketing and Branding, Part 3: Raising funds successfully. The Board's role is to set strategic direction, financial oversight, deliver the mission by setting and overseeing organizational goals and priorities, and lastly and most importantly, to help fundraise by seeking new corporate members, sponsors, grants, and large charitable donations.

RONR is used in special and general Board meetings to manage the agenda and conduct business. You do not need to read the entire thing, but definitely read sections 44-45 for voting, 46 for elections, 47 for officers, 49 - 52 for Boards, 56-57 for bylaws. There are many other sections that are relevant, but RONR is more used during the establishment of an agenda, and understand and follow a process during meetings to avoid any perceptions or actuality of improper motions. The Executive Director has the full version for reference during meetings, so Directors may choose to buy and use the Concise version. If there is conflict in meaning or understanding, the full version will be consulted in meetings.

Directors can either be reimbursed for the purchase of the books (particularly useful for eBooks), or the Foundation can send them to you.

### Completing Director qualifications

- [ ] If you are not a financial member, Directors must become a financial member by the time they join the Board on January 1. The best way to do avoid any issues with standing and lapsed membership is to become a Lifetime member, followed by taking out sufficient sequential one or two year memberships to cover their entire term, or to use the ability to automatically renew membership.
- [ ] New Board members must complete their induction reading and Board Source training before they sign the [Directors Commitment Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/directors-committment-agreement) to fully understand the role of the Board, and their fidiciary duty to the OWASP Foundation.
- [ ] Directors who do not sign the [Director's Commitment Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/directors-committment-agreement) are not covered by OWASP's Director's and Officers (D&O) insurance, and may not sit or vote on the Board to prevent indemnity issues.
- [ ] Each year, the Foundation must obtain an updated [Conflict of Interest](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/conflict-of-interest) questionnaire from each Board member. Directors can update this form at any time during their term. If a Director has a conflict of interest, they must [declare this interest to their fellow Board members, and recuse themselves](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws#section-702-disclosure-required) from discussion and voting. Bylaws have precedence over policy if there's any confusion.

If a Director fails to meet the qualifications set out in the bylaws, the Foundation will inform the pro tem Chair, incoming Chair, or incoming Board as a whole. The Board may decide to vote to declare the position unfilled through disqualification, and then fill the Director's seat per the [bylaw's vacancy process](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws#section-205-vacancies).

### Getting ready to be on the Board

Directors who can hit the ground running from the first meeting onwards are a true asset to any organization. We would normally expect the following to happen before the first general Board meeting.

- Please come to the remaining Board meetings before you take your seat to familiarize yourself with Board meetings and meet many of your fellow Board members.
- The new Board should meet in a Special Board meeting to decide who will be the Board officers before the first general public meeting. This takes 1-2 hours.
- The new Board should meet in one or two Special Board meetings in January of each year to set goals and strategy, and communicate this to the community and Foundation.
- The Executive Director will meet with all Board members, to listen to your platform, goals, agenda, and ideas to make OWASP better and achieve our mission.
- The Executive Director or Operations Manager will work with the Board to establish a calendar of public Board meetings. You will need to set aside two hours on the fourth Tuesday of each month, and sufficient time to read the agenda and any pre-reading materials to prepare for the meeting. If you have any questions about the agenda or materials, please contact the Executive Director in the first instance.
- Please put time aside time in your calendar to travel and attend all of any in person AppSec Global events. Regardless of the format of the conference, there will be a public Board meeting at some point during the conference. AppSec Global events are a chance to meet with OWASP Members, Corporate Members, Event Sponsors, and participants, and listen to their feedback and concerns. Please make the time to attend all of the conference. Board travel and hotels are paid for by the OWASP Foundation.

### Board functions

- Vision, Values, and Mission. OWASP has a new mission for the first time in 20 years. A strong and clear mission statement provides a lens for the Foundation to prioritize, or do less of, or not do at all.
- Strategic direction. Each Board should set their goals, priorities, and strategic direction in a special general meeting early in the year
- Fiduciary duty. Directors are accountable for Board decisions and Foundation actions
- Financial oversight. The budget is set between September and November each year, and must be approved in the first general meeting of the year to permit spending on programs above the Executive Director's signing authority. If you want to get something done that will cost funds or better bring money to the Foundation, it needs to be in each upcoming budget, or it won't happen.
- Fundraising. Every non-profit needs to fundraise. The Board must focus on bringing in funds, corporate members, sponsors, and donations.

The Board delegates operational aspects to the Foundation. Please work through the Executive Director when directing the Foundation, so that staff don't end up with 7 bosses.

The Board has delegated some of its powers to various committees. The Committees are governed by the Committees policy, and advise the Board, and have some decision making power relating to their charter. Committees are asked to provide a budget and objectives each year. The Board must approve the budget, and can scale back or increase funding. The Committee can spend budgeted money, but is not authorized to spend unbudgeted funds. Each committee has its own charter, published on the main website. This doesn't mean the Board can't make decisions in these areas, but should consult with the Committee prior to any motion, consider their advice, and ensure there is general support for a motion within the charter area.

### Working with the Foundation

The Board is welcome to communicate to the Foundation through the Global Board list, and [email](mailto:andrew.vanderstock@owasp.com) or [meet](https://calend.ly/owasped) with the Executive Director.

The Board should not communicate directly with OWASP staff to avoid staff having "7 bosses". From time to time, the staff will directly communicate with the Board to complete or work on a Board action. Please work with staff in a timely fashion.

The Board should track such actions arising or tasks for the Foundation through a [Public Board Actions Kanban](https://github.com/OWASP/www-board/projects/1)

### Working with our community

Most leaders are encouraged to monitor their owasp.org email. However, Board members have a higher duty to independence, and avoid any perceptions or actuality of conflict of interest. Directors MUST use their OWASP.org email address for all official business.

### Making motions

The Board should be the primary source and driver of the agenda, motions, and discussions. Please submit all motions to the Executive Director no later than one week prior to a general public meeting, so the agenda can be published publicly with 7 days notice as required by the bylaws.

All motions require a Board sponsor, so if a community member or staff member wants to introduce a motion, it is through a Director's sponsorship of the motion. The Director sponsoring a motion should be prepared for a discussion on the motion, familiar with all pre-reading material, and answer questions from the Board about the motion prior to any vote. The sponsoring Director does not need to support the motion, and is free to vote against it. Most motions require four "yay" votes. Changes to policy and bylaws requires a two thirds affirmative vote (generally at least five "yay" votes). If a Director wants a motion to pass, they should build consensus with the Board well before the meeting.

### Agenda and Pre-Reading Material Preparation

The agenda will be finalized in a Board officers prep call seven days before the general Board meeting, which is not a special or general meeting (so despite quorum, no votes can be taken). 

Staff and financial board reports and all pre-reading material will be finalized by close of business on the Friday before the Board meeting. 

### Be prepared each Board meeting

Well informed Boards have efficient and highly productive Board calls. Unprepared Board members violate their fidiciary duty to OWASP, creates unnecessary delays during the meeting, and likely misunderstand the motions, which can have devastating consequences.

Directors *must* read all pre-reading material, review (and potentially correct) the previous minutes for accuracy, staff reports, motions, and discussions. This will normally take about an hour or two per month in the days prior to the general Board meeting. Directors can ask to have the minutes corrected, question the sponsors of motions, or ask the Foundation about staff reports through the Executive Director.

### During meetings

The Board meeting will generally be online five minutes before the meeting, and will start promptly. Any Director who is not present after the first ten minutes is considered absent. Missing more than 25% of the meetings in the year is grounds for a vote of confidence and potential removal. An earlier Board made a convention that all Board members must have their video camera enabled for virtual calls. If you need to have your video off, please ask the other Board members before doing so.
