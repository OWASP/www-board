### CHANGES TO THE AGENDA

Changes to the agenda - unless otherwise prohibited

### OLD BUSINESS

### STRATEGIC DISCUSSIONS

Discuss previously parked planned activities:

- Future Board Structure

    Grant presented the "aspirational" structure of the board today as being elected to be representative and democratic and as being strategic and not operational. The concerns with all those aspects (and the reasons they are aspirational) was discussed too.

    The board discussed possible options to modify this structure including possibly chosing to appoint seats rather than being elected to them - either for all the seats as per the Open SSF board (large donors are awarded seats) - or for a more moderate approach where the ED appoints advisors to the board, up to two, that would provide professional board experience.

Activities parked for the next session
- Strategic plan for raising funding
- Strategic plan for Projects
- Strategic plan for Events
- Role of Committees 
- Tooling for the future
- Staffing for the future

### ADJOURNMENT

#### Adjournment motion

The next general Board meeting is on 28 February 2023, at 7:30pm Central European Time [convert](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2023&month=02&day=15&hour=19&min=30&sec=0&p1=398&p2=16&p3=110&p4=197&p5=217&p6=136&p7=179&p8=438). 

However, Glenn proposed a hachathon style session to try drive more movement towards a plan. Grant purposed that Glenn should put a Doodle together for that to see if we could get enough of the board involved for that.
