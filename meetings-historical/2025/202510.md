#### Discussion on the Community Policy Review process

**Background** The Board will discuss the Community Policy Review process, including how policies are reviewed, who is involved, and how feedback is incorporated. This discussion aims to ensure transparency and community involvement in policy development. One issue that needs to be addressed is how best to move the policy through drafting, pull requests, issues, and processing feedback from the community. Another issue is replacing the policy team seating requirements with a working group model.

#### Discussion to modify the Membership Policy to add benefits for Distinguished Lifetime Members

- Sam will prepare a formal policy modification for next meeting.

#### Discussion on updates to the OWASP Board of Director's Code of Conduct on election campaigning

**Background** A discussion needs to be had on if or to what extent the OWASP Board of Director's Code of Conduct should be updated to include guidance on election campaigning. This follows recent events during the 2025 Director elections where some candidates engaged in campaigning activities that raised questions about fairness and adherence to ethical standards.

**Summary of Issues Discussed:**

- Director endorsements of candidates.
- Accuracy of candidate claims.
- Directors should not endorse candidates.
- Candidate campaigning rules belong in the Election Policy, not the Director Code of Conduct.
- Staff must remain strictly neutral.

#### Discussion on proposed Director Qualification and Election Policy changes

**Background** Avi Douglen has led a proposed change to the Director Qualification and Election Policy for Board discussion, creating a new draft policy for consideration, replacing the old Election Policy. This policy has received feedback from the community, which has been incorporated into the current draft by the Policy Review Team. The new policy proposes stronger qualifications for candidates, conflict-of-interest clarifications, and ranked-choice voting (STV). The director qualifications in the new policy is not applicable to the 2025 elections for Director qualifications, but the new seating procedure will be used for the 2026 Directors.


NB: Policy is not yet ready for vote pending Policy Review Working Group review.

Discussion also covered:
