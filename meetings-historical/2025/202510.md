### NEW BUSINESS

#### Summary of Closed Board Meeting

**Background** Prior to this public Board meeting, the Board met in a closed session to discuss strategic matters, such as AI policy to be created, amongst other topics. This is a chance for the Board to summarize the closed meeting outcomes for the public record.

#### Discussion on the Community Policy Review process

**Background** The Board will discuss the Community Policy Review process, including how policies are reviewed, who is involved, and how feedback is incorporated. This discussion aims to ensure transparency and community involvement in policy development. One issue that needs to be addressed is how best to move the policy through drafting, pull requests, issues, and processing feedback from the community. Another issue is replacing the policy team seating requirements with a working group model.

#### Discussion to modify the Membership Policy to add benefits for Distinguished Lifetime Members

**Background** The Board will discuss a proposal to modify the Membership Policy to add specific benefits for Distinguished Lifetime Members. This change aims to recognize and reward long-term commitment and contributions to OWASP.

#### Discussion on updates to the OWASP Board of Director's Code of Conduct on election campaigning

**Background** A discussion needs to be had on if or to what extent the OWASP Board of Director's Code of Conduct should be updated to include guidance on election campaigning. This follows recent events during the 2025 Director elections where some candidates engaged in campaigning activities that raised questions about fairness and adherence to ethical standards.

#### Discussion on proposed Director Qualification and Election Policy changes

**Background** Avi Douglen has led a proposed change to the Director Qualification and Election Policy for Board discussion, creating a new draft policy for consideration, replacing the old Election Policy. This policy has received feedback from the community, which has been incorporated into the current draft by the Policy Review Team. The new policy proposes stronger qualifications for candidates, conflict-of-interest clarifications, and ranked-choice voting (STV). The director qualifications in the new policy is not applicable to the 2025 elections for Director qualifications, but the new seating procedure will be used for the 2026 Directors.

**Motion** "Resolved, that the Board approves the Board of Directors Policy, replacing the existing Election Policy, effective immediately."

- [Feedback Summary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XOeOPEOUIZZ6qjrRP9b5SSKMmAyERHYxmI9c6bggjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

NB: At this time, the feedback hasn't yet been agreed by the policy review team due to the feedback closing COB Friday Oct 31, 2025. This likely means that the vote on this policy will need to be tabled until the second November Board Meeting. 

#### Discussion chapter leader orientation course

**Background** Sam Stepanyan will discuss the chapter leader orientation course and training, with a view to starting a Working Group to create the course. Working group activities and proposed change to the chapters policy. Should the policy be changed to make the course mandatory for new chapter leaders?
