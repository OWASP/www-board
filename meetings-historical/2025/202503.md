### Committee Reports

#### Q1 2025 Update from the Events Committee

15 minutes

**Background** Encourage regular cadence of reporting activities, accomplishments to the board. Provide an overview of the objectives achieved Q1, planned Q2/Q3 activities, etc.

### NEW BUSINESS

#### Discussion on combining GenAI and AI Exchange Projects

**Background** The GenAI project has many sub-projects, but not including the AI Exchange project. There are likely synergies between the two projects, and it is proposed that the two projects be combined into a single project.

The Board may wish to direct the Project Committee to review the situation and interview key stakeholders, and come back with a recommendation by the May Board Meeting.

#### Motion to promote the GenAI Project to Flagship

10 minutes

**Background** Scott Clinton will provide an overview of the GenAI project, its many achievements, roadmap, budget, and the benefits of promoting it to a Flagship project. The Project Committee supports the promotion of the GenAI project to Flagship status. The GenAI project has a PR package ready to go if approved.

**Motion** "Resolved, that the OWASP Foundation Board of Directors promotes the OWASP GenAI project to Flagship status."

Sponsor: Steve Springett
Second: Avi Douglen

#### Discuss flagship projects

Avi Douglen will lead a discussion on the current flagship projects and their status.

#### Motion to amend November 2021 motion to open Charity Charge and close Amex

5 minutes

**Background** Since moving back to Australia, the current corporate cards constantly lock out both the individual card for Andrew van der Stock, and has on one occasion, locked all credit cards out, causing a series of missed payments. Due to Amex's rules on closing active credit card accounts, the closing of the personally guaranteed Amex has not been possible, and it is still open but lightly used, contrary to a previous motion made by a previous Board to close it.

The previous motion was to open a Charity Charge card and close the Amex card.
""

This motion is overrides the previous motion to allow Andrew van der Stock to use the Amex card for primarily for OWASP travel purposes, and where a transaction is likely to lock out the Charity Charge card(s), such as foreign currency transactions without a noted travel advisory. The purpose of Andrew's Charity Charge card will become primarily for operational purposes and where Amex is not accepted.

Lastly, due to the number of staff cards issued, the current overall credit limit is $50k as agreed with a previous treasurer, and so the motion should amend the amount to correct the factual basis of the original motion.

**Motion:** "Resolved, the OWASP Foundation Executive Director and CFO are authorized to establish Foundation secured corporate credit cards for staff expenses and travel, with a total limit of $50k USD. The Executive Director is authorized to continue using the Amex card for travel purposes."

**Sponsor:** Harold Blankenship
**Second:** Ricardo Griffith

#### Discussion on establishing a funding committee

15 minutes, Discussion sponsor: Ricardo Griffith

**Background** A Funding Committee should be established to provide strategic direction, oversight, and management of funding initiatives, ensuring that financial resources are effectively allocated in alignment with OWASP's mission and goals.

- Overseeing fundraising campaigns and initiatives.
- Managing the allocation of funds to various OWASP projects and events.
- Ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance with all financial regulations and OWASP community guidelines.

#### Discussion on establishing a marketing committee

15 minutes, Discussion sponsor: Steve Springett

**Background** A Marketing Committee should be established to provide strategic direction, oversight, and management of marketing initiatives, ensuring that OWASP's brand, mission, and goals are effectively communicated to the community, stakeholders, and the public.
