### e-Votes and Special Meeting Motions to read into minutes

#### Motion to approve Vienna as the location for AppSec EU 2026-2028

**Background** This is the second motion to decide if we are to host our AppSec EU conferences from 2026-2028 in a single location, Vienna.

After a successful site visit by Sam (thank you for that!), we have received very favorable pricing for holding AppSec EU in Vienna for a period of three years at 157k per year.

**Additional information**

- The costs of Food and Beverage (F&B) bill, which are not included in this contract, would be charged separately, are comparable to other venues that we obtained quotes from. 
- The costs of hotel rooms are in line with other European cities at this time of the year
- The timing of the event would be the same dates for all three years, which is something that the Board has wanted, and allows us to plan and advertise well in advance, similar to the way it happens with other major events like RSA, BlackHat and Defcon.
- We would only need to register for VAT once in three years, which simplifies the management of ticket sales and invoicing for sponsorships.

**Motion:** "Resolved, the Board approves the Executive Director signing a contract with Austria Center Vienna as the host convention center for AppSec EU 2026-2028."

- [e-Vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqOiF-bXo5oSyXefO_8FT3smkYfnRnzbn7qPTsKQyH83gqEQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=102207325192678137930)

**Sponsor:** Harold Blankenship
**Second:** Ricardo Griffith

- **Result: 6 YES 0 NO 0 ABSTAIN. Motion passes.**
