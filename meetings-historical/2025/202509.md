### NEW BUSINESS

#### Discussion on the OWASP Commercial Entity with Gesmer Lawyers

**Background** Gesmer partners will be joining to discuss / answer questions on the formation of a commercial entity for OWASP

Aaron Kriss and Russ Schossbach joined the meeting to provide Legal guidance on forming a for-profit subsidiary (e.g., “OWASP Solutions”) owned by OWASP Foundation

**Key Points:**

- Common structure: 501(c)(3) owning a for-profit subsidiary for non-mission-aligned activities
- Purpose: Separate commercial ventures (training, consulting, certifications) that may not fit OWASP’s tax-exempt status
- IRS requires operational independence between nonprofit and for-profit entities
- Overlapping leadership is permissible but must avoid control conflicts
- Delaware incorporation recommended

**Discussion Highlights**

- Ownership: Typically wholly-owned subsidiary (100%)
- Outside investment: Possible but uncommon; must consider investor expectations and ROI
- Profit distribution: Board of subsidiary decides dividends; cannot be mandated by the non-profit
- Donations from subsidiary to nonprofit allowed if independence is maintained
- Licensing OWASP trademarks or content to the for-profit must align with OWASP’s mission and IRS compliance
- Certification programs, training, and consulting may remain under nonprofit if directly mission-aligned
- Lobbying by the for-profit possible but must remain independent
- Merchandise sales taxable; manageable under nonprofit
- Risk transfer (e.g., certification liability) could justify use of a subsidiary

#### Executive Director’s Report – Andrew van der Stock
- [OWASP Foundation Board Summary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O1oTy7_IHCIz_cXCIybgcuMiG4u-G9VcBySmpAHNaH0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Staffing:**

- Marketing role final candidate selected; awaiting offer confirmation
- New hire based outside the U.S. 

**Website Migration**

- Nearing completion; final QA and staging checks in progress
- Migration aims for a modern marketing-focused site
- Minor outstanding items: committees page and www-community migration

**Audit & Budget**

- Audit on track; FY26 budget work underway with Harold

**Working Groups**

- Automation for creation and tracking being implemented via Google Workspace and GitHub

**Belgian Entity (OWASP EU):**

- Awaiting Belgian government approval for new entity
- Old entity winding down; awaiting coordination from legacy directors

**Membership:**

- September membership drive performing well; above budgeted targets

**H-1B Visa Update:**

- Recent USCIS changes ($100K filing proposal) highlight benefit of OWASP’s remote-first employment model

**Board Elections:**

#### Upcoming Events – Lauren Thomas

**Global AppSec DC:**

**AppSec Days:**

**Future Planning:**

- Full 2026 events calendar to be shared with exhibitors at DC for early sponsor budgeting

Board thanked Lauren and the events team for their continued strong performance


#### Motion to optimize the Community Review Policy process

**Background** 

The Community Review Policy process gives 21 days for public comment and a subsequent 30 days for the Policy Review Team to consider the comments and make a recommendation to the Board. This can lead to a long delay in approving policies. This amendment would parallelize the public comment period and the Policy Review Team review period, reducing the overall time to approve policies.

**Motion**: "Resolved, that the Community Review Policy be amended to conduct the public policy review period and the Policy Review Team review period concurrently." - **DEFERRED**

**Sponsor:** Ricardo Griffith
**Second:** Avi Douglen

Motion tabled, discussion took place instead

**Discussion:**

- Ricardo proposed streamlining to accelerate policy publication
- Sam suggested data analysis of past policy reviews before making changes
- Andrew recommended ensuring adequate pre-reading and public communication
- Board agreed to defer decision pending data


#### Discussion chapter leader orientation course

**Background** Sam Stepanyan will discuss the chapter leader induction/orientation course and training, with a view to starting a Working Group to create the course.

- [Chapter Leader Orientation Course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJWuoLZGvBccy4m-cUdre3RjxF7r-iOQpYkkxV7Jtdo/edit?usp=sharing)

**Objective:**

Introduce a mandatory orientation training for new (and eventually existing) Chapter Leaders to ensure compliance and consistency.

**Key Features**

- Video-based learning modules with a short quiz.
- Topics: OWASP mission, chapter operations, event policies, sponsorship, expenses, and use of shared tools (Zoom, Slack, etc.).
- Passing the quiz is a prerequisite for signing the Chapter Leader Agreement.

**Board Discussion:**

- Harold: Supported; noted it will require policy amendment to enforce.
- Steve: Supported; asked about tracking effectiveness and tool requirements.
- Diego: Suggested extending to all existing chapter leaders.
- Ashwini: Supported; emphasized keeping training concise and recurring annually.
- Andrew: Recommended pilot phase, then integrate into annual leader confirmation process.
