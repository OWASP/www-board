#### Discussion on committees

**Background** The Board wishes to discuss the current status of all existing and forming committees.

"Avi Douglen requested an update on new committees. Andrew van der Stock provided an update on the Marketing and Outreach Committees."

#### Approval to invest excess funds in Certificate of Deposits and to open a money market account

(This agenda item is new and needs to be approved by a super majority of the Board prior to discussion and voting, or moved to an e-vote after the Board meeting.)

**Background** The OWASP Foundation should earn interest on excess funds to further our mission and to help offsite banking fees. The Executive Director wishes to invest excess funds prudently in a total of three 90 day CDs totaling $500k renewing one per month, and move the rest of our savings to a money market account to increase earned interest every year. Access to six months of operational reserve is all that is required, and the rest should be invested prudently.

Currently, the OWASP Foundation has $1.7m in its savings account, and $100k in a $100k 60 day CD. After fees, we earn approximately $0 in interest every year on the $1.7m. We earn about $5k per year in interest on the $100k CD. At current market rates for CDs and money market accounts, the OWASP Foundation could earn an additional $45-50k per year on its $1.8m in excess funds, whilst still maintaining 24 hour access to $1.3m of it, and no more than 90 days to access the rest.

**Motion:** ""Resolved, the Executive Director is authorized to invest a total of $500k in three rolling 90-day Certificates of Deposit (CDs) with our current banking institution. The Executive Director is authorized, by the end of August 2024, to research a suitable financial institution that provides money market accounts, obtain final approval from the OWASP Treasurer, and open a money market account with the OWASP Treasurer as co-signer. He is authorized to transfer the OWASP Foundation's savings to the money market once opened. The OWASP Foundation Treasurer and OWASP's accountants will be granted read-only access to the money market account for visibility and accountability. The Board will be informed as funds are transferred, and continuous financial reporting will come from OWASP's accountants every month."

**Second**: Avi Douglen

#### Approval to open a line of credit with our current financial institution

(This agenda item is new and needs to be approved by a super majority of the Board prior to discussion and voting, or moved to an e-vote after the Board meeting.)

**Background** The Treasurer wishes to discuss opening a line of credit with our bank.

**Motion:** "Resolved, the Executive Director is authorized to research and obtain final approval from the OWASP Treasurer to open a line of credit with our current financial institution, with a maximum limit of $500k. The Executive Director will provide the Board with the terms and conditions of the line of credit once it is established."

Vote PASSES **5-0**.

#### Approval to move credit cards to our current financial institution

(This agenda item is new and needs to be approved by a super majority of the Board prior to discussion and voting, or moved to an e-vote after the Board meeting.)

**Background** The Executive Director wishes to consolidate staff credit cards to a single financial institution to simplify accounting procedures for our rolling credit, and improve visibility into our monthly credit card spend. Our current credit card provider's website is less than transparent, somewhat difficult to work with as staff, and we can only provide statements to our accountants once per month. Our current financial institution provides better management of the cards, real-time visibility into spend, and the ability to provide statements to our accountants at any time using their existing access.

**Motion** "Resolved, the Executive Director is authorized to move all staff credit cards to our current financial institution, and to close all other credit card accounts by the end of 2024. The Executive Director will provide the Board with a list of all credit card holders and the current credit limits once the transition is complete."
