### Executive Director Report
#### Website

Work continues to get the website launched before December 20th. In our view this is a great time of the year to relaunch our website. Our plan is launch and then have two weeks for fast-follow on key issues/concerns over the slower traffic holiday season. Key tasks either ready for testing, in testing or complete include:

- SEO Mapping of old/new link format/structure (over 70% of inbound traffic re-mapped by THU)
- Primary nav content items (work in progress with Governance and Policies)
- Projects either updated or migrated
- Chapters either updated or migrated
- Updated Donation workflow
- Updated Membership onboard/renewal
- Responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile

Migration of Projects and Chapters continues at a slow pace. Right at 15% of Projects (126 of 148) have not updated their pages on the website and only 7.2% of Chapters (257 of 277) have completed the work.  After a great deal of work and deliberation we have elected to programmatically migrate pages that have not been updated by leaders to also include a disclaimer page explaining why the page may not perform as expected. This means all Chapter pages, regardless of Leader participation, will have an end-point at launch. This is critical to maintain SEO integrity.

After a variety of conversations, there is only really one substantive outstanding issue raised by the community (more accurately ~ four people), and it concerns URL structure. We have brainstormed several solutions and are in contact with GitHub on how we might implement these changes. Our current estimate is to make this change - even with GitHub's help  - is likely 40-60hrs of rework/retooling. If GitHub cannot help us with migrating credentials, it could easily double the LOE of this work item. And worse still, all of this work would fall on Harold who already has high priority items like SEO link mapping that are far more critical for launch. We have not closed the door on this change; but we are hesitant to delay the project at this time.

Again the complete plan and milestone list is https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/201912-Website-Launch.html

#### Projects Summit

Work continues in our planning for our first Projects Summit for February 27-29, 2020 in Cancun, Mexico. We have signed the contract for the venue and plan to open Project Applications just after the first of the year. Project details: https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202002-Projects-Summit-Q1

#### Conferences

Interest in joining Program Teams is light (only three applicants thus far). We are now promoting this opportunity on our Twitter accounts and will be doing some additional email campaigns to increase buzz about these opportunities. Both Global Conference contracts are signed and project plans are online at:
* https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202006-GlobalAppSec-Dublin
* https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202010-Global-AppSec-SF

Reports are that BlackHat London OWASP presence was a success. Staff supported local members in hosting the booth.  AppSec California sales are going well and are at $294,950. You can check the current status at https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202001-event-appsec-california.html
 
#### Preparing for 2020
The Operating Plan has been available for Board review these past several weeks. Whatever feedback Iâ€™ve been receiving I have been iterating and plan to have a budget ready for Board approval at the December call.  https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/operating-plan/2020

#### Miscellaneous
- Due to the holidays, we have cancelled the December Connector
- Our new Membership/Donation form will collect GDPR consent, something that our current system does not. There is staff project (Email Cleanup & GDPR https://www2.owasp.org/www-staff/projects/201910-Email-Cleanup.html) that we intend to complete next month that will scrub our entire email lists to get us into compliance.
- Our donation form will allow visitors to be listed as a supporter of Chapters and Projects
