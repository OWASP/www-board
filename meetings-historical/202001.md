### Executive Director Report

#### Website

The website was launched on WED, January 15th. Our original plan was to launch over the Christmas holiday but ultimately we elected to give the community another two weeks of time to migrated their content.

As of this report, only 66 of 285 chapters to have migrated their content (23%), and 38 of 145 (26%) of Projects have migrated.  It was decided that at launch if a chapter or project has yet to migrate we would take a snapshot of those pages and place it on the affected chapter/project with a warning and link to /migrated_content.  Harold also wrote code to stand up an accurate leaders.md file for each project/chapter so going forward the leadership of record for OWASP will be contained on the respective web page.

Traffic since launch has stayed constant. We took an 80/20 approach to SEO/Redirects and thus far the trendline is tracking against that goal. There is still traffic going to the old wiki but they are long-tail links. We have disabled editing the wiki as the new website is the path forward.

Migration of the new website coincided with our retirement of Fontiva for Membership management and renewal. Membership information is stored in both Stripe and Mailchimp. Mailchimp is now being used for membership contact (onboarding/renewal). Individuals can check their membership status without a password through the /manage-membership page.  Donations are now being processed on Stripe as well. We are in the process of retiring other paths for these user actions.

Our next web project will be an Events tool. We are several weeks behind schedule on that project but are working to pull in that timeline.

#### Projects Summit

Work continues in our planning for our first Projects Summit for February 27-29, 2020 in Cancun, Mexico. As of this writing we have seven projects that have applied. Total number of project-reported attendees is less around 20. Application process closes on Sunday. Project leaders have received no less than five notices regarding this opportunity. Project details: https://owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202002-Projects-Summit-Q1

#### Conferences

Program Team for Dublin has been selected and meetings have begun for this June event. San Francisco Program Team nominations is closing this week.  Both microsites are online but are not taking registrations. Both Global Conference contracts are signed and project plans are online at:

- https://owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202006-GlobalAppSec-Dublin
- https://owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202010-Global-AppSec-SF

Staff is prepared to execute an agreement for Berlin 2021 and there is a Board resolution on tomorrow’s agenda.

AppSec California sales are winding down with $320,000USD in sponsorship sales.  72% of standard event sponsorships for AppSec California were consumed by Corporate Sponsors. This means there is ALREADY $230,000 revenue booked just from these sponsors for our Global AppSec events.You can check the current status at https://owasp.org/www-staff/projects/202001-event-appsec-california
 
#### Preparing for 2020
The Operating Plan has been available for Board review these past several months and a budet for over a month. These items are again on our agenda for January call. https://owasp.org/www-board/meetings/202001.html

#### Honorary Memberships

Staff is no longer processing Honorary Membership requests. Upon review of our policies and ByLaws the Board needs to define a new process for this pathway to membership.  Updates coming shortly.

#### Policy Work
While we had the goal to completely update the Foundation’s policies prior to the website launch, we are making good progress.  I am recommending the Board adopt our new Donations, (https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations.html), Expense (https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement.html), Membership (https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/membership.html, and Signatory (https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/signatory2) policies.  Very shortly and prior to the board meeting I will be sending a narrative on substantive changes worth noting.

#### Miscellaneous
- Non-funding ticket SLA breach have been on the rise due to primarily a lack of staffing while closing the website migration.
