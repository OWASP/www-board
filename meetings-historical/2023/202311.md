### NEW BUSINESS

**Background** The 2022 audit results are in. A quick update on the audit results, and the next steps. The management letter will be discussed in a meeting the day after the Board meeting. The audit report will be published on the website once the management letter has been discussed. If I have the public 990T, I will also publish that at the same time.

#### 2023 Global AppSec DC Update

**Background** The Global AppSec DC conference was a success. A quick update on the conference from the OWASP Foundation staff.

#### Membership price increase

**Background** The current membership prices of OWASP membership hasnâ€™t changed since December 2010. Since then, CPI has increased by 40%, which means a 40% real reduction in membership income since 2010.

Although we have had a lot of new individual members since 2010, the reality is that our costs have also increased to manage the program. Since 2021, the membership program has been profitable in its own right, as well as providing members with membership benefits.

A board discussion on the merits of a price increase.
